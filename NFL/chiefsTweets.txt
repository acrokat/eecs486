Absolutely disgusting. This airline needs to be shut down!
This doctor had a patient waiting for him. He did not deserve to be treated like this. Damn you @united
CEO apologized for “having to reaccommodate these customers.” Really? Company's actions and their response inhumane. #volunteertoflydelta
Yeah!! Lawsuit!!!
When you have so much money and become so powerful and treat people like commodities it's time to show United who pays the bills. Boycott!!
F United
Right. Disgusting but not surprising anymore.
Looked crazy. First class, next flight, $500.00 voucher, I'm up. I'm betting now, this guy was flying standby.
I am sure that united escalated situation & there were multiple personnel there who probably didn't even understand y an assault occurred.
I'm sorry. I mispelled f*ck off.
Police were watching, but the person who assaulted the man looked almost like tarmac personnel.
Pay what?

Cops, TSA are more like Security Officers with no powers of arrest.
Wasn't United legging were American an never let them on. Free fliers because of family employee. Violated dress requirement. Pay attension.
This makes me so upset! That poor man I feel so sorry 4 him
Those were TSA or cops.
He did... he bought his ticket arrived on time was seated then refused to give up his seat 4 a late arriving united employee! #assbeat
Not much choice down here, but there HAS to be more to the story.
of course bud
Bring @jcharles25 back home @Chiefs #prayer#please

I used to check Military Id,s s you came onto post
This poor man! Seeing cops' behavior at the airline's behest (obviously; they didn't send them in with a compensation check) is outrageous!
There are many great Law Enforcement Officers out there and most never have to draw their weapon or let alone shoot someone
Is that how people act in China? Throw temper tantrums?
yes, but I don't think this was the case. Failed to comply, forcibly removed. No gun, taser, club, just dragged off.
Oh yeah.

Anyways I do support Law Enforcement Officers but there are a few bad apples out there not many.
think tha woman in the hiijab 2 rows up "Volunteered" him actually...
I take it your not a Military Veteran then other wise you would know what a MOS is
My Military job was Military Police nothing fancy about it I spent most of my time at the Gates
Ima wear a hijab to stay safe
flight17
Agree 100% and they should have!!
United could of put its Employees on another Air Lines and saved everyone the trouble.
MOS?
My MOS was 31-B I would tell United Airlines employees to do their own dirty work and I would walk myself off the plane.
Sure, very possible. Notice how everyone quick with their camera phones, but NO ONE quick to stand up and volunteer. Think about that.
Clark Hunt's name came up twice today. The @Chiefs lobbyist tells @CornejoForMO that Hunt has a suite but doesn't live at Arrowhead. #moleg
Discusting!!! Buh bye United!
pic.twitter.com/pea9NiFEGv
Not all Police Officers would be willing to drag a man off the plane for not giving up his seat. I would tell them to choose another person
Makes you wonder about them having a random passenger generator.

Fly Alaska Airlines or Delta Airlines but never fly United Airlines unless your into S&M, free beatings on every flight.
Stop, or I'll say stop again! To what point should one go before using force?
Yeah... Both suck
put on leave until investigation is typical. He will be back as he did nothing wrong.
Terrible incident.
Boycott @united and sue @united until it bankrupted.
And a wrong way to do the job the Police Officer is not a credit to the men in blue.
Really the Police Officer was suspended after this, hopefully he will be fired for his actions, there is a right way to do this job.
I already wasn't flying United https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4z Oqozo …

A picture is worth a thousand words and thousands of dollars.
Can we say "Boycott"? I can...Ya need a weapon on board to be safe. Sorry for that poor man...

Bright side is he will soon have YUGE stock options in united airlines.

United has sunk to a new low- terrible for more than 25 years
Pats vs Lions
Will not fly unless absolutely required, I'll drive 18hrs first.
They probably could say he was interfering with the flight, failure to obey flight attendants, etc... imagine the fine print on ticket.

Apparently @united only gets in their "Fly the Friendly Skies" mood, if you live through the beating before takeoff.
Awesome!
Well at least they tossed him before the took off
This is horrible. Poor guy.
Not so much while on the ground.
The way it looks it's kinda confusing.
2 home 2 away
Still,they take him out and he runs back in the air plane screaming?
On the flip side, when security asks you to get up and exit. You go. Dude got the snot knocked out & probably could be charged

Or Chad Kelly. He's the best QB in the draft but has character issues. Andy isn't scared of that one bit. Plus bloodlines don't lie
Honestly I'd rather take the #BuckyPlan and pick up Mixon and Sidney Jones in the 3rd. Risky but could be well worth it.
