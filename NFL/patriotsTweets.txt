Let me guess, because he's white and short? Not to mention quick as shit. Of course he's a fit there.
Peppers isn't a 1st round talent anymore. The scouting reports have said . Isn't dependable on defense, he's just a special teams player.

Pats need a RB more than another WR. This is one of the best drafts for RB's. They can get young, cheaper power back in the 3rd round.
We need another receiver we only have 5 potential starting receivers Edelman, Cooks, Hogan, Amendola, & Mitchell. Switzer would be perfect!
Jabril Peppers is by far and away the most logical draft choice for us. He's so versatile and elite. He's like an insurance policy
he's a white return special list of course
we don't need another receiver
Absolutely
Sure ig

Can the @Patriots sue ??
For what
@HeisenburgBRFC It was too easy
I don't think their confident at all. I think they're worried Lebron, TyLue, Kyrie they are on the same page but the others look lost

Marshawn Lynch Has Expressed Intrest In Us @Patriots
if Marshawn @MoneyLynch to the @Patriots then that answers the illuminati/patriots affiliation question
@LG_Blount > #marshawnlynch 10/10 times! @Patriots fans want you back.
D'onta Foreman or Ryan Anderson would be great with the Pats
@maxkellerman With that said Bron sat out a game where had they won last night wouldve solidified the bulls chances to make the PO's
@maxkellerman had SAS Hemmin and Hawing about the Magic/Isaiah thing. Clearly Dwade vs Bron trumps Bron vs the heat.
2nd round at best with the way the Cavs are going.

Ya quiero saber toda la info del juego de @Patriots vs @RAIDERS en el aztecaaaaaaa
Am I the only one who still gets amped thinking about the @Patriots winning the super bowl?! 2 months later and I'm still pumped #NE
@Patriots get 1st & 52nd picks from @Browns and select Myles Garrett in exchange for Jimmy G and Butter. @MikeReiss @tomecurran @nflnetwork
They are in the East. One of the few things that would shock me in basketball is if they didn't make the Finals.
The Tomato can Texans get to be knocked down twice this year.

The @Patriots would never get @MoneyLynch because @LG_Blount is like 5x better!
You can only get lucky so many times. I wish Giants were good enough to meet pats in SB so they could whoop that ass and watch OBJs tantrum
Can you imagine Butler and Gilmore lined up on each sides of the line? I really hope that's what we'll be seeing this season.
. @TuckerCarlson vs. @sethmoulton is like the @Patriots vs. @AtlantaFalcons in the second half. #YoureMyBitch
Goals: see Tom Brady & the @Patriots play at Gillette stadium & see @SportingKC play at Children's Mercy Park
Dumb giants fans think they'll have another shot at the Pats. You'll be watching the blitz for six from the couch like Eli & Co will be.
Look like somebody might need to get some injections
But but 5 rings.... "Dumb Pats fans"
Giants again? Let's call that game the "Anual Patriots-Giants Preseason Meeting" once for all.

Did I just hear @985TheSportsHub say the @Patriots are looking at Beast Mode....?
@Patriots make it happen!!! #BeastMode https:// twitter.com/bleacherreport /status/851537357648121857 …
Marshawn Lynch to @Patriots "lol" yeah right he hates them..... Remember that one Pats fan who Lynch threw away his Patriots jersey
The preseason schedule is set. @Panthers vs. @Patriots @Saints vs. @dallascowboys #WeAreTexans pic.twitter.com/2Nc61WbDkn
@Patriots who would I need to talk to in order to come workout for the scouts and coaches? Looking for some direction
#NFLFreeAgency LeGarrette Blount has no plans to sign @Patriots standing contract offer
Still praying that the @Patriots re-sign @LG_Blount #29
@Arsenal need to take a leaf out out of one of the @Patriots mottos and #DoYourJob
. @Patriots might as well try n sign LeBron since y'all signing the whole world, b.
That be scary! No one can stop the @Patriots as currently constituted. Imagine if we landed @MoneyLynch and/or @RSherman_25 #PatriotsNation https:// twitter.com/bleacherreport /status/851537357648121857 …

That awkward but awesome moment when the @Patriots realize they don't have a place to put their 5th Super Bowl banner!! #FirstWorldProblems pic.twitter.com/zh3JYWTJWb
The only thing that makes this remotely plausible is the non- @Patriots teams of the AFC East have been dumpster fires for 5 years running

Is beast mode going to be a @Patriots this year if he comes back http:// nyp.st/2nVwcVb via @SMUSportMgt #NFL @nypostsports
Dear @Patriots give the rest of the NFL a chance. PLEASE.
I can't root for @MoneyLynch in a @Patriots uniform that's for sure
To be honest I think Richard Sherman's and Lynch's agents are just using the @Patriots as leverage for other teams in the league interested.

@Patriots hopefully you get @MarshawnLynch24 to NE #beastmode in progress

Bad! Tom is a liar. #Bigly
That would never hold up in court. Fake news!
Yep. Proof. It's there in blue and white. pic.twitter.com/V0cVworZSc
I deny all accusations.
You just did.
Are you trying to get me to say Tom Brady's my daddy?
Don't deny your feelings. You know it to be true.
Never!
Yes you would.
I wouldn't.
Que ingrato el tenia contrato en seattle y hora porque no quiere jugar en seattle
NO team is unbeatable. In fact, just ask the @Patriots if that's true.
I need a second car.. is $1,000 enough to win bid? @Patriots
#InsertNewPlayerHere wants to join the @Patriots . No kidding, They're winners. I'd wanna join too. #Patriots #GOAT

Practice? We talking about practice? Really? Practice?!
He should enjoy retirement and not try to get back in the game.
Report: The @HoustonTexans & @Patriots may practice together during training camp at @The_Greenbrier : http:// cbsloc.al/2o126k0 via @MikeReiss
You looked like genius' when they took your picks, now it's not working. Keep going against the grain and build a 5-year team.
