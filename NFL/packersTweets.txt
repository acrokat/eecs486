I caaaant. So cute
Best player at either CB or pass rush. Having one helps the other
@packers https:// twitter.com/bleacherreport /status/851895133910036483 …
House, Gunter, Randall, Rollins and a young CB is a solid 5
@packers @VictorSau22 #nationalpetday #GoPackGo best one #packerspet pic.twitter.com/9oJgPetGsG
Yeah. I like House, but as a No.4 guy. If they can draft a good CB in the first two rounds, I'd like our CBs...
I'd agree with that. Regardless of if those two bounce back, you have to replace Shields.
I could see that, especially if TT believes Randall/Rollins will have bounce backs yrs. I do think they will draft a CB either day 1 or 2.
I really think OLB is a huge need this season, even more so than CB.
Well, duh ;). I could see the Packers going Biegel or Watt, though, too
wouldn't be too upset with that. You always get one Badger in there ;)

#nationalpetday coming at you from small town Illinois @packers pic.twitter.com/wGR7sPXB2M
Packers can address all of their needs. Draft 2 corners, 2 running backs, and a guard. They only need a couple pieces
how would you like this, @brennen_rupp @Noah_Hanstedt ?
@packers last time we got a corner from another team potentially this good it was C.Wood! #ThinkOnIt https:// twitter.com/bleacherreport /status/851895133910036483 …

ALL THE WAY DOWN!
Who?
I know it's not and never will be @packers style and won't happen, but considering the lack of a secondary, can we at least take a look? https:// twitter.com/bleacherreport /status/851895133910036483 …
Estimado @cprocuna antes que nada un saludo, mi pregunta es: ¿por cuál CB deben ir @packers en el draft?
Gotta get my push ups in after lost. #nflbrotherhood #pushups @TheOpening @NFLLegends @coachmeans_20 @packers @ChicagoBears pic.twitter.com/QNKRVoBIN1
I doubt it on the draft they would got to hit on the undrafted FA as well.
Wes we both know YOU are the best free agent available right now#WHYNOTWES @Colts @JimIrsay @cirsay @Panthers @NFL @RAIDERS @packers
border collies rule!!!
@packers Sherman
Our biggest need is CB tho?
They need to grab a corner as well with one of their first 2 round picks
Can they draft an entire defense? In a Word, no
Making room for Richard Sherman? Please?
I disagree with Gary on Dline. They have 3 top 45 interior guys with Daniels 9, Clark 36, Jean-Francois 45. ILB, CB, OLB are their 3 needs
Can the @Packers address all their needs in the draft? @GaryEllerson says DL and MLB are needs and can be addressed pic.twitter.com/e2tJSqwery

Al rato voy a ver a Oorbel para ponerle su cabeza de queso.
There's tons of corners in this draft that would be great
That's why I'm saying at 29 not gonna be a CB that really is that and can start and make an impact like a RB can
Don't sleep on D'Onta Foreman! Hopefully @packers draft him in round 3
We need the speediest ball hawk type players and they go quick
We can have Rodgers carry us without a great rb we just need a defense
too cute

Looking like house and Randall are gonna be the starters with rollins as a nickle
I just think we really need matching @packers jerseys for Grant, the pups, and I #goals
@packers https:// twitter.com/bleacherreport /status/851895133910036483 …
I would love if Sherman came to the @packers . Very smart corner who would bring leadership and an attitude that we need! https:// twitter.com/bleacherreport /status/851895133910036483 …
pic.twitter.com/bLs60C0qw2
I like a CB but honestly picking a CB that high won't help as much as a RB would not alot of CBS come in and start...
Taco says hiya. #PackersPets pic.twitter.com/EmioM3v3XQ
Bark Starr ;)
I crave the heartbreak.
Have faith
@packers what's it going to take to sign @BradPaisley to a 1 day contract? That's all I need for my friends to finally come to my house.
Defense heavy or not a contendor team cant rely on rookies.We are gonna get derstroyed again
I doubt he'll last long but I say a corner in 1st a pass rusher in 2nd and probably a rb or a guard in 3rd
So your taking a CB is cook is there???
Draft RB Foreman hopefully in the 3rd round if he still there...
True but dam Devin Cook would look amazing in a packers uniform if he's still there
100% CB
@packers https:// twitter.com/bleacherreport /status/851895133910036483 …
More cb than rb
This secondary is Super trash releasing another trash that can't stay off the weed k my helps...gotta go CB and RB first 2 rounds
@packers can I get a retweet/like or a shout out for the biggest Packers fan I know on his birthday?? #GoPackGo

I got good news for you though GB comes out here in 2018 vs Rams and 2019 vs Chargers so you get to see them back to back years
You're lucky for that sir
On Wisconsin!!! @PabstBlueRibbon and @packers in the same episode! @BetterCallSaul #BetterCallSaul
I'm glad they are coming to Cleveland. 2 hour drive instead of a 12
Yup damn
I knowww.. or at least playing the Rams out here instead of Green Bay
Dang @AleniHernandez it could of been Packers at Chargers instead of Denver. That would of been cool.
New Mexico loves the @packers ! @BetterCallSaul #BetterCallSaul
I was at the Dodgers game last week and the guy sitting next to me was a Packers fan and he told me about it and i even looked it up.
I've lived in LA my whole life and I only know a couple Chargers fans. The owner just posted a letter and left SD, that's complete bs.
Well there go my chances of watching them how did you find out they'd be in London ?
Exactly all their fan base is in San Diego they shouldve left them there and brought raiders to LA most people here love raiders here
Packers are playing the Rams in 2018. But that game might be played in London, it's getting me more disappointed by hearing that news.
I personally thought the Chargers leaving San Diego was bullshit bc the fact that no body cares about the Chargers here in LA.
Making a trip to Wisconsin this year, I'm trying to see you play! @ClayMatthews52 @Packers
Packers vs Eagles, let the games begin!
We might have to wait a while usually packers play against changers in cali but now that they have moved out San Diego idk how it's gonna be
The more I look at @Chido___ on tape we might have to evaluate him and take a little closer look @packers
See you in Pre-Season !! @LambeauField @Packers
Makes two of us now
LA has 2 teams now and the Packers aren't playing either team in LA. So disappointing
That's what I said rn too !!
I'm so mad why couldn't the @packers come here for preseason against the @RamsNFL @NFL fix that shit I'm tryin to see my team here in LA
@AdrianPeterson Time to return the favour. Favre came to the Vikings, now time for AP to come play for the @packers ! #JustMakesSense
Rashad Jennings is killing this season! I'd take him in a @packers uniform. He's a great man #DWTS
New episode of Better Call Saul best scene was in the mechanics shop #GoPackGo #Packers @packers
Props on the line!!! Great work!!!
I didn't even know these existed. SUNUVABEEOTCH! I'm interested.
These bad boys come in white?
@Packers lowkey should draft Reuben foster
@Andy_Benoit Schematically, does Blount match with @packers O? Haven't heard any chatter but think he'd be an upgrade from Lacy. Thoughts?
I don't buy expense stuff with kids and stuff but this is on my Father's Day/Birthday list fingers cross
Great kicks @StephenCurry30 you should take some notes.

Absolutely
part of what makes the NFL fun is that its so unpredictable. Who thought the Falcons were gonna get to the SB and then blow a 28-3 lead?
"We'll see about that. It could happen but we'll see."
The lions could possibly take the division too
We'll see about that. It could happen but we'll see

Certainly. The 8pm EST game is open to all teams. The @nyjets have hosted the game twice. 2010 against the Bengals and 2012 against the Pats
I see what you did there
What are the odds of a game in NYC on Thanksgiving? Is it even remotely possible?
If you guys think a rookie CB is going to come in and save this secondary your crazy , trade some picks for a veteran CB

Broke my heart on the last minute bid being a born and raised cheesehead....
I agree with @TomOatesWSJ about the @packers offseason thus far defense hasn't improved and have to rely on @AaronRodgers12 to do it all
So @packers , when we going to sign Hankins?

U can have a dream that Jay Cutler was the Bears' best QB ever
Oh yeah, the Bears are 2-15 against Aaron Rodgers.

Packers would have to fire Thompson
That being said, why are the most famous "Curly's" bald? And was "Curly" Lambeau ever one of the Three Stooges? Before Joe Besser, maybe?
Hey! His hair's not curly? Wth?!?
Hands down @haha_cd6 is the best safety ever on the @packers
I hate to say this @packers but trade the 1st round and 5th round pick to Seattle for Richard Sherman. Trust Ty Montgomery or sign AP.

@packers Trade for Sherman!!!!! Please! We will win the Super Bowl!
Lol I'm not wrong I'm simply stating facts. Unless an extension happens, Ted done after this year. Simple.
Hahahahaha whatever man I'm tired of going round and round with you.. you're wrong. Sry.. go away
But until those things happen, it looks like Ted is done after this season. All indications point that way
Or Eliot could end up being the GM and Ted leaves. It doesn't really matter right now
No cuz an extension could still happen & Eliot could still take a job somewhere else. Like I said if he was that good he woulda been hired
Him being on the last year of his deal with no extension, with a future GM under him that is promoted constantly is no indication?
There's no indications of that like I've been saying so you thinking that way shows your bias
As I said previously, I don't mind TT. But the likelihood is him being gone
It could go a bunch of different ways.. not even worth discussing..you want him gone so the only likelihood you see is him being gone
If he's not under contract then he isn't with the organization
No it means his contract runs out and nothing more.. doesn't mean he walks away.
What's multi? U cited ian and he "reported" on how he might be gone after this last season n that was quickly proven wrong so what's next?
Ok, let's not speculate. As of now, he is done after this year because that's when his contract ends.
So again let's speculate lol that's my point.. y'all wanna make up some shit that isn't there
All of these multiple media outlets aren't biased against TT, dont say it's a conspiracy
He said he's not going anywhere now, didn't point to future
It's media speculation and fans desperate hopes and dreams cuz most of em hate him with no real justification
And yet the head coach said there's no indication he's going anywhere and doesn't see him slowing down..
Never said fire, his contract is up soon and many have reported he's likely to step down then
But yet fuck him let's fire him n get Eliot in there just cuz
News org out of Chicago trolls @AaronRodgers12 . Just to help - his name is spelled C-H-A-M-P-I-O-N. @chicagotribune @packers #MVP
Why would I be? I don't mind TT, I think he generally handles FA well and drafts usually well. I just think something may be up

Prospect Primer: OL Adam Bisnowaty, Pittsburgh : http:// pckrs.com/m7j4 pic.twitter.com/Gvrlkb8uMQ
He is what we need in Greenbay
Man, I can believe I missed the Ashland stop! #GoPackGo
I don't think it's his choice as much of whoever gives the best offer, which New England is more likely to do, but I doubt they will
Is that your ride your standing next to?
True... unfortunately I can't imagine him coming to Green Bay over New England
Could be a high price. Looking @past trades the Bucs traded for Revis in 2013 for 1st & 4th round draft picks. GB has a lot of picks tho..
And @JakeRyan_47 - there's your hodag, pretty close to Sasquatch
personally I liked them together and I just love Chance and Frankie Rodger's! Will miss them cheering for the @packers
I've been saying this! Not sure how we would get him or what we would have to give up, but we should try!

Thank you so much! My kids had a blast! This is one of the many reasons the Packers are the best organization in the @NFL
I AM A @packers fan. I LOVE THE GAME. I DON'T CARE ABOUT BREAKUPS AND FAMILY DRAMA. UNLESS IT EFFECTS THE GAMES I DON'T CARE. LET SHIT GO
Any Hodags come to visit?
Rhinelander hosted a great #TailgateTour Party! : http:// pckrs.com/r7x2 pic.twitter.com/uocpkh0OhS

@packers SB Champs
Earlier today
Can you come to Woodruff???!!!Please?!
Can you come to Lakeland union high school?!?! Please?
Of course! All the cool stuff happens after I graduate....
I've watched them in 3 Super Bowls & many NFC champ games. Consistently in contention. The Pats aren't the only good team believe it or not
Aaron Rodgers TEAM is his FAMILY @packers
This year
BAHAHAHA that's right Don't mess with @AaronRodgers12 or @packers fans #GoPackGo https:// twitter.com/PackersFans_/s tatus/850508875765862401 …
I've been a @SFGiants fan longer than a @packers fan. https:// twitter.com/mxr124/status/ 850528053608534022 …
His name is Rodgers. Aaron Rodgers. You know him only too well when he & the boys come to town to kick Bears' ass. @packers @AaronRodgers12
I don't even know you anymore
lol success is success my friend. Pats have been great lately but GB is still Titletown until you catch up.
@chicagotribune tackling sexism and @packers all in one headline. #GetEm https:// twitter.com/chicagotribune /status/850351552682446848 …
We're very excited for upcoming season! Go Pack Go!!!!
Nothing like a good wrist workout!
You wouldn't be tailgating out to California, would you? ;)

3 Super Bowls in 50 years isn't helping your case. Referencing championships before WWII isn't helping either
@packers pick up Blount!! https:// twitter.com/NFL/status/850 453175563722753 …
Good lookin' group!
@packers @UofAlabama Please disregard inaccurate reports tonight about condition of my dear friend Bart Starr. He is fine & at rehab today.
Fair enough indeed pic.twitter.com/AHUk4kuQHY
Thank you for correcting the earlier report.
. @packers great Bart Starr beats back another health scare, back at re-hab! Here's more! https://www. facebook.com/RickKarleWBRC/ videos/1230013353714766/ … pic.twitter.com/zQriSge6kI

I will see the #PackerFamily on Saturday in da UP at the @packers Tailgate Tour!! #GoPackGo https:// twitter.com/packers/status /850499495007850496 …
@ChicagoBears @packers rivalry is real. Maybe best tweet ever https:// twitter.com/chicagotribune /status/850351552682446848 …
Rick, You are mistaken. I spoke to Bart,Jr moments ago, he worked out w his father today at rehab & Bart,Sr does not have staph infection
What, @chicagotribune ? You can't even say his names after all those years of defeating the @ChicagoBears ? #GoPackGo @packers https:// twitter.com/chicagotribune /status/850351552682446848 …
I dont know why they would disrespect a man who has been owning them for years? pic.twitter.com/SKPU5jpkjm
Was Ferguson taking the pictures all day or did he leave the tour? @jasonjwilde
About to get our ball signed @packers tailgate party!!! #cheesehead #hodags pic.twitter.com/KTkWIvzYRo
Packers are the closet actually cuz the need for us is more plus #RichardSherman wants to win and knows he can do that with our @packers
@JONNYKINNEY
Good things the Packer organization does for kids and communities. Proud to be a lifelong fan. Go Pack Go!!!
Drives me crazy when fans blame girlfriends. #Scapegoat
hahaha oh damn
They sent a troll tweet at Aaron Rodgers and the masses responded by sending them every Aaron Rodgers highlight vs the Bears lol
I'm hearing all over that #RichardSherman is headed for @packers .. still waiting to hear from @RapSheet
Murphy knows how to party.
Man you are desperate

Lol, hope the @packers respond with a gif for every bumass QB the Bears have started the last 25 years https:// twitter.com/chicagobears/s tatus/850455740766720000 …

Yeah thats his official title, doesn't mean that's what he actually does. Would you want your last year to be with a demotion?
Just not the gaps people want..
And when Eliot got the raise he explicitly said this has nothing to do with me retiring and he's been aggressive in FA before to fill gaps
pic.twitter.com/T9TN2Td2Ba
Aggressive in free agency. Doesn't add up.
@gregcote Show and Tell
I'm saying there's substance for question. First Eliot gets a promotion/raise. Then TT is seen less around facility/practice. Then GB is
@amcd95 headed up to hodag country
Hahaha ok bro.. believe what you want..
Nowhere does he say he's still the GM, it was reported that he may become a scout.
Rodgers? His first completion went for 0 yards and not a touchdown

Do you know Ted's back? Are you in the organization?
Ok, even as a @packers fan, acknowledging sharp trolling by @chigagotribune. But never forget that @AaronRodgers12 owns the @ChicagoBears pic.twitter.com/Mgbp4X3zRZ
And then what got reported after the season actually ended? Teds back! Aww sad.. I know it makes "fans" sad
ICYMI @Packers won the NFC Championship in @ChicagoBears Soldier Field........ Maybe leave the baaaaaaaaad man alone.
@AaronRodgers12 @packers @ChicagoBears When you go 13-34 the last three years #FridayFeeling #Don 'tTalkAboutTheBest #KeepYourMouthShut
Hakeem Nicks Laugh
Uh no,actually, Ian Rapoport reported he will step down shortly
Lol that backfired for @bears social media guy. When QB1 has that many guy wrenching highlights against you, tread carefully. @packers
I can't help but point out that both the @bears and @packers have beaten the @patriots in the #SuperBowl lol.
And he and MM both said after the season hes not shown any signs of slowing down n age in a GM position doesn't mean shit..a dream by "fans"
His first pass was a touchdown
His contract expires soon, hasn't signed extension, is already 64. Pretty obvious
Watch out for Hodags.
Says who? Lol or is that a hope of every one and speculation by the media?
Ted does need a replacement lol he's retiring soon
Except Ted doesnt need replacements & if they truly wanted him they woulda paid him enough to lead him away. If he was that good he'd b gone
Fear the Hodag.
Suey
Glennon threw 19tds and 9ints as a rookie and rodgers didnt even play
But is best available in the league thus pretty damn good and a perfect replacement for Ted
@packers Good Evening Green bay Packers Happy Friday HI I am a huge fan of you how are you doing have a good weekend and night :)
Take Gilmore this year.. got paid like a top 5 CB despite not playing that way his entire career just happened to be the best in the class
Have fun @packers

Just cuz someone else wants you doesn't mean you deserve it over a proven guy. Just means ur the best available could still be shit
@packers go for it https:// twitter.com/nfl/status/850 487120280027136 …
@packers @RSherman_25 could help now all we would need is pass rush and Oline help
#BearDown pic.twitter.com/BW91ewT7fI
@packers get @RSherman_25 give them the second and a fourth next year
You don't get the show
@Simmotre1Trent does that sound like a good trade?
Hey @packers fans, how about we all retweet this to @AaronRodgers12 Right before the Bears game and piss him off so he torches the Bears
The @packers really need to address our CB needs by trading our 1st and 3rd picks for @RSherman_25 #JustDoIt #GoPackGo #SB52 #HelpOutAaron
Cant dress up for halloween?
@packers Aaron should have his focus back after the split with Munn- it's about time
Just so there's no misconceptions that all I buy is @packers stuff. Just picked up my @bcraw35 @sfgiants jersey today. #WeAreSF pic.twitter.com/7Ihn5zlPpm
Vai chegar mais descansado nos jogos kkkk
The @ChicagoBears want to talk to the @packers about QBs pic.twitter.com/PD9RHREzk4
@RSherman_25 should come to @packers
This is a guy with an elephants memory, take the @packers spread be damned when these guys meet next.
NBA team accounts are really good. Have seen some good ones from NHL. Carolina Panthers a solid NFL one.
