The @buffalobills should sign the deer.

if watt IS better than von, it certainly isn't by much and considering what von has done for the broncos, id keep him
he's only behind a tiny bit and has had to share with the rest of the broncos monster Dline from 2012-2015 watt was a one man show most time
Your looking as good as ever btw
@buffalobills yo peeps whats hauschkas number gonna be
Insane. At 10 you draft a guy equally as meaningful, with age and $$ on your side. Only trade early picks for Sherman for a SB run.
Should the @buffalobills rescind the trade offers they made after he missed stretching last week, @DrewBoylhart ? https:// twitter.com/SalSports/stat us/851855356288532480 …
speaking of trades: Richard Sherman to @buffalobills for the Bills #10 pick?

He's just mad he looks like a young version of George Jefferson
Malik Hooker falls to the 10th pick
Just like every year, either a bust, a star that is hurt/suspended 80% of the time, or an average player who'll be gone in 4 years.
Mike Williams
Chad Kelly no doubt
I think we'll pick another bust. That's what I think... #frustratedbillsfan
Players need to keep coaches really close to them during their careers. You never know who may end up as your boss on a new team later on.
Whomever you chose, it will not work out. 100% guarantee.
If you pick a QB at 10 I'm live streaming my suicide
Mike Williams
Mike williams
Mike Williams
My guess...Detroit. its usually the 2nd home game

Not at all. They are still working on him. They don't want to make the same mistake w him as they did EJ.
34 #1
Stop with this culture change crap just make playoffs and go from there wins make it all better
Welcome and best wishes for success, whatever the develops into!
Chris Brown retweeted his own tweet...er the Bills I mean...smh...awesome
You have someone fake take your legendary player away from you and see how you feel about it
Lol! They're getting so upset they're acting like they actually lost Von. Hilarious response!
It's fairly common for @buffalobills fans from upstate areas far from Buffalo to support New York City teams in other sports leagues.
Working at the arena as far back as 1992 has made @QueenBusko a @NYRangers fan, but she remains a @buffalobills fan. "Love my Bills."
Have the Bills given up on Cardale Jones?

I know right. Super excited to spend a thousand bucks for seasons riding on false hope
Yay! Or Yay?
Nah. Watt one injury. No suspensions
Just seen this. Congrats @Isayow8 you about to kill it in @buffalobills
Oh please. Firing rex is an upgrade and you know it. And yeah Yates is a camp arm. Probably won't even make the roster
And the Patriots.
Why Cam still #1? Outside of 2015 he is 36-39 with good (not great) stats in 5 of 6 years & no SB ring. #1 Watt/Von, #2 Watt/ Von, #3 Cam?
We lost a DC. The @buffalobills lost the entire coaching tree! And signed our dirty laundry in TJ Yates! Only thing you have is aging shady!
Same guys that were already there? Seriously??
Do some research loser. Not gonna happen. When's the last time the phins actually won a playoff game? Poops guess the phins suck too.
When @buffalobills lose their franchise to another city, we will all just sit back and laugh at you as they win a Super bowl outside Buffalo
More SB rings. Less injuries.
So was Matt Ryan up until this yr.. so was tony romo, most of qbs in league come up short in playoffs. He gets u there..

Dalton is a choke
Dear @buffalobills just so you know, I will never upgrade my season ticket seats until you give me a reason to do so #playoffs @Schopptalk
Fuck that ginger snap
What about Shaq & Ragland? Dareus & Darby?
Section 118. Come visit sometime
I am seriously so proud
@buffalobills have passed up on drafting Matt Ryan, Von Miller and Gronk....Can't wait to see the franchise changer they pass on this year

Von has less tackles and less sacks despite playing in 5 more games
Where is Andy Dalton? 5 straight playoff appearances in 6 seasons. I saw some of players ahead of him and it was kinda disrespectful
lol I take Von over cam all day- MVP and a ring!
Been knew McCoy was a clown... same dude ran off the field n cried like a Bitch when the @Eagles whooped @buffalobills asses. Glad he gone

I'll keep Von thanks
Happy Birthday Bills Wall of Fame #89 Steve Tasker......you were simply The Bills best special teams player EVER! #Comeback
Broncos would still take Von miller over jj watt any day
Love JJ Watt but Von has shown more productivity and ROI
We will still take vonnie @Millerlite40 but thanks.
Beast started with @buffalobills he would NEVA go to those jerks!
oh boy. Did Pegula's or Whaley have anything to do with this???
Richie looks ready for UFC #PancakeServer
Pretty sure Broncos would still take the super bowl MVP
Yeah!!!! Let's Gooooooooooo #GoBills !!!!
Lets hope this team is the 1st Bills team to get 2 playoffs in 17 yrs
I would bet the Vikings would love to have drafted Dalton instead of Ponder
How many retweets for the @buffalobills to automatically get into the playoffs? @NFL

Suck it Miami!
Winning?!?!
Broncos fans in here saying Von>watt are just fan boys, I love Von but cmon, Watt's future w/injuries only thing that would push Von ahead

Tasker was the original Was Walker. Just didn't get WR chance soon enough.

it's Tyrod's team for a maximum 1 year or until we draft a QB who doesn't suck.
I don't see how Dalton doesn't get into the first round of this when there are still a decent amount of teams without a good QB
Just mailed my 13 cassette tapes to the @buffalobills
It's not real dummy no need to get worked up over a fake draft
Nice to see Marcus Gilbert get some respect here. Very underrated
Because he's been the best player in the game since he was drafted let alone the best defensive player.
Is it really a schedule when they give you date ranges? Are we going hype up another release when it's actually finalized?
Know how you know when you win a fact base arugement, the dude chumps up and blocks you. Can't have a conversation that way @LanceZierlein
it's too late. He's gone.
I had fish tacos on the day I created this redraft. One of the fish was a blowfish. Admittedly, I might have been poisoned... but not high
Can the @buffalobills get him to replace @ZachBrown_55 ? With that closing speed would be natural on the weak side. Priority UFA! #sleeper
4-0, 0-4... doesn't matter, it's the pre-season. I'd rather go 0-4 in pre-season and make playoffs!

If the Bills are looking for a great QB, we'd like to suggest @TyrodTaylor . Oh, wait... You don't need a new QB, @buffalobills ! https:// twitter.com/profootballtal k/status/851524847695998978 …

I hear the road trips live up to the hype
Cancel the preseason
Not the best immediate fit for him. Easy to see why they'd be intrigued though
If they loved you that much then they'd put a decent product on the field for us
1) we're taking von no matter what. 2) i'd rather take tyron smith over jj if we're doing this.

@Schopptalk I call BS on this QB talk. @buffalobills want other teams to think they are interested in a QB to build value for a trade down.

I'm liking the moves that were making before the draft getting excited for the season to start
Don't you get anytime off
haha I'm back :)
I thought you were in Fla or on Vacation
No way, forever @Millerlite40 #Broncos

Not sure how I feel about this @TyrodTaylor #
I'm still taking von miller over watt
Precisely why I never mention my love affair with Vernors Ginger Ale, I just buy the 4-6 six packs at HT whenever I catch it on the shelf
I don't talk about these things usually because I want to be able to buy them before they run out.
I wish the @buffalobills did a season of hard knocks this season @NFL @ESPNNFL
If you haven't had Sahlens dogs, go to @HarrisTeeter and buy some immediately they are the best hot dogs you'll ever have
I missed this but the @buffalobills official hot dog @Sahlens got naming rights for Wake Med's main stadium http://www. newsobserver.com/news/local/cou nties/wake-county/article141936249.html … #blessed
"In hindsight we should've taken Watt instead." - Does this not sound incredibly stupid to anyone else?
bills fan here,Terry,knows the NFL,is about the passer,qb.. he wants trubinsky
In what universe do the Broncos not take von miller? I don't want to live on that timeline. Buuuuuuuurp
Come to Buffalo.. @buffalobills
I still think this is ridiculous. Why would we ever redo this draft and draft a guy who's not Super Bowl 50 MVP
I got Watson playing for the
Broncos would still take Von, give Watt to the Panthers
It's a losing, non-playoff team so yeah, it's "Tyrod's team."
@buffalobills @TJ_Yates TJ got the arm but Field got the hair. Another W for Field. #06010

Come back to the town that you started your career in @buffalobills
yeah, that makes a lot of sense...
Who?
Broncos would still take von you hacks lol
So JJ Watt is better than Von Miller? I don't think so.

how would pick AJ over Julio?
Um no
There's no disputing that fact. Bills Superbowl LII champions confirmed.

good now get Cardale on the field to play O and not just as wildcat. 2 QB in backfield will confuse D and gives lots options.

pic.twitter.com/NDGiUcJQh0
Maybe cause they are both named Taylor
idk but he's def the GOAT
I disagree. Yates has more potential and a way higher ceiling. Mccown already peaked. And he's 37
Yea but he's still better than TJ Yates
@buffalobills has to be @JimKelly1212 or @OJSimpsonKnife
Great sigining.He'll win you some ball games when needed.
They could give one to the @buffalobills as Buffalo doesn't know anything about that championship life #Bills #BillsMafia #Patriots https:// twitter.com/bostonglobe/st atus/851481499841032192 …
Wow how did the manage to sign the GOAT??
idk man. There's a reason why he's on his 8th team I think
I would rather have Josh Mccown
Is that cuz both of you got fiveheads
Stick to SJW'ing
could be worse... could've been josh mccown
lol you're forgiven buddy I know they don't make you guys that smart over in Canada. Stick to hockey
@buffalobills @TJ_Yates believe no one thinks that T.J Yates will take @TyrodTaylor job
Buffalo is Glad to have you back.

@buffalobills fans might be the worst
Great sign
you just posted numbers with no context. If that's the bills salary they can afford Kap. Go back to your rock now
Congrats TJ!
Houston we have a problem.
Se parecen
He's not my anything. Read up on that salary cap screenshot I posted for you, Groovy Tony
he's your back up because cardale sucks. you can go back to hiding behind your stick figure now.
he's a backup.... not competing for a starting job
Yates: "This is Tyrod’s team. I’m here to bring leadership, knowledge of the system, and make the QB room better." http:// bufbills.co/fATZ3L pic.twitter.com/6pe1R7ZVPe
I fail to see the irony. Irony is getting upset at a 3rd string QB signing for 3rd string money and feigning outrage Kaep isn't signed.
@G_reller the bills are going to the playoffs this year apparently.
Lucky us
not upset at all, it's just ironic that someone with a "fuck it" avi wants to talk to me about logic lmao
I'm sorry my avi upsets you, muscles.
tyrod sucks buddy wake up lol your avi just spews logic you're right
Get that work!
Logic is one thing I can assure you, you know nothing about.
Looks like our QBs will get along just fine. More on just-signed T.J. Yates: http:// bufbills.co/fATZ3L pic.twitter.com/Z4rU1q5b3K
You familiar with what a salary cap is? You do understand they signed Tyrod right? pic.twitter.com/RH9CIu19AP
his stats from 2012-2014 are more than decent. '15 was bad for everyone there but last year Kap did okay
#who ?
Unleash the Yates of Hell!
Possibly doing some advanced QB scouting?
he had one good year and literally hasn't done shit since then, everybody has film on him easy to gameplan for
They will win the Superbowl now go bills
@buffalobills TJ Yates, huh? #BillsMafia pic.twitter.com/XcgZ9EL4Pe
all I'm saying is a 1 year 8-9 million dollar contract isn't too much for a dude that was on super bowl teams
Take all these smoke screens by @buffalobills GM Doug Whaley and throw them out the window. Whaley will take WR Mike Williams at #10. #Bookit
I hate you.

not worth 9 to 10 million a year! That's insane!
Yeah offense needs a serious upgrade. Hopefully they add someone at the trade deadline again
Oh Mccown shouldn't be paid that much but oh well Kaepernick still sucks balls can't read a defense
Not a Terry Collins fan. Yes, healthy is key, but Reyes at SS, Duda at 1st arent gonna get it done in order to win
I need what you're smoking if you think Kap should be paid less than McCown.
I think Mets will be fine. Just gotta stay healthy!
Watch out league, TJ Yates is coming for u
No, not at all! Our Mets are in trouble, but my O's are team to beat in AL
no.....can't read a defense he isn't worth 9 to 10 million maybe 5 million
Bears signed Glennon to starter money when he's never been good. McCown got 6 mil. Kaps worth more
The "player to be named later" in @derek_boyko trade w @buffalobills https:// twitter.com/eagles/status/ 851454504348389376 …

That uniform combo.....
Great as always! You?
FRAAAANK. How ya been?
LMAO Kaepernick wants 9 to 10 million a year to be a BACKUP f that noise
What number will he wear? I need a jersey Asap
LMFAO so true or a teacher or some shit lol
Also just signed Yates. pic.twitter.com/31hUzIUWTk
so you rather spend whatever it is on a dude that's never gonna help the team? lol that's great logic
tj you should know i spent 10 mins staring @this pic looking for something to make fun of and i couldnt Congrats Todd Talley would be proud
I think @buffalobills new signing of QB TJ Yates, could take over as our starter. I like him much better than Tyrod Taylor. We r better off!
You think Kap is signing for 3rd string money? Get yourself together man.
No Thx
I actually like @buffalobills signing QB TJ Yates, he's a playoff QB (Twice) and reliable. Im much more comfortable w/him then Tyrod!
Wow....start designing the championship rings now @buffalobills pic.twitter.com/XfenzmT72R
Got a new bills fan. Good luck TJ
Kap is way better than this scrub
@buffalobills @TJ_Yates I'll take the under on that

New IT guy?

dude looks like a math teacher or the schools librarian
also went to UNC. Mentor?
Oh boy oh boy. Should I be excited

Dareus was there too... So was clay.... Hmmm
We will be back within the next 3 years
it's alright you've still got a great team with your core players still in place & in their primes. You'll be fine
We could've won if we had caught any of those. We choked that fucking game
Tyrod must've left his smile under his seat
Touche lol but still.
We dropped 4 INTs tho
will play a good game for the first half or first three quarters, then Brady just takes over
Offense slowed down as well. But yeah I agree. Honestly though, it was probably more NE's offense. They do that to Buffalo a lot. Buffalo
The 4th Quarter are defense just died. Our Defense lost the game
it was boring during that time
I was rooting for you guys although I didn't mind the Pats winning.. it was a good game except the two middle quarters lol
I'd rather not. I just want to destroy the Pats. Hopefully that will die down the fucking 28-3 comments
let us win
Well we play you this year.
As long as Sean McDermott can improve our defense even a little bit, were a playoff team. Our offense can be great at times
Nothing wrong with the Bills tho. Someone gotta beat the Patriots
Yeah I figured that by your picture lol
lol not a Bills fan so I wouldn't know many. Only know the QB and a former Falcons
Eric Wood, Richie Incognito... Maybe Ryan Groy?
Richie Incognito and Eric wood are on the left and right of Tyrod
I love this!!! #Billsmafia
Tyrod and DiMarco is all Ik
I know Patrick DiMarco on the left, then I think Richie Incognito, Tyrod Taylor, and Eric Wood.
Tyrod Taylor is #21 @buffalobills about right, it could be worse @RGIII is the @Browns starter https:// twitter.com/TheNewArena/st atus/775860049017057280 …

The @buffalobills lost @BumpNrunGilm0re to the Pats "IF" they replace loss w @RSherman_25 vs TB12 2x yr would be interesting #buffaloBills
Is this what it's come to? @buffalobills pic.twitter.com/EuIf09LUR0
@buffalobills draft suggestions first trade down for more picks. The offense is I think 2 players away from being complete go def. with rest
@RSherman_25 would look good in a @buffalobills jersey and add that needed secondary depth in Buffalo #billsmafia

The question is, can he throw the ball? And can you he do so accurately? Otherwise it will be another disappointing season for fans.
@buffalobills please sign Verner and Boldin. Thanks #BillsMafia
Don't tell me what to do.
and now he has a direct tie to a dumb tweet
would be nice to see scoreboard but northtown,fanduel, signs block full view.
now he has a direct tie to a miserable franchise

NOT A JOKE. I think Tim Tebow would lead the @buffalobills to the playoffs next season at QB.

Don't blame you. Don Sheldon responded to emails and left voicemails. Hoping on 4/25 I can move up and get some better seats.
Felt very disrespected
That's crazy. My rep called and emailed up to the deadline.

@buffalobills McDermott, not T.E.'s please! For 1st grab a BAMA LB or DB not Kipers's choices they stink! Remember @ckelly_10 in later RD's.
Football is this mans life, especially when it comes to the @buffalobills @TyrodTaylor and shady @CutonDime25 .
