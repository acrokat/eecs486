What OBJ really loves is attention. This @Giants fan wants him traded for a LT or pass rusher. If not, he'll be an overpaid decoy in 2017.
AI in the house. "...,Talkin bout preseason man! Come on...."

If I have time before the Draft I'll try & Pop up @the Mara Family's office in East Rutherford & see if the @GIANTS can draft Rueben Foster
@PapaCastGiants seriously??? This is a no brainer
Time to boycott these wings.
Here are 3 reasons the @Giants shouldn’t waste an early NFL draft pick on a quarterback, via @garymyersNYDN http:// nydn.us/2p4EVpZ pic.twitter.com/5bibD8LKOe
That we won against your Pat's and your GOAT(which he is not)to make it even sweeter I'll definitely take SB 42 the greatest SB in history!
If your gonna take 7 SB app n 5 rings You also got to take the two times he cheated and who 2 out of the 5 SB. Ill easily take those 2 SB
I hope this isnt some profiling bs because of whats going on in korea atm
Of course you'll take 7 SB app n 5 rings And its funny how you don't mention Eli haha who killed and slayed your "GOAT" I'll take 18-1 SB
Eli almost had 5,000 in 2011
Only QB in NFL history to throw over 4900 yards & win SBMVP the same year. People who say he does nothing in reg season are such morons.
Hes a paying customer who was told to get off the plane so they can let an employee take his seat, fuck out of here with your apologist BS
No thanks, they had the man beat because he refused to "volunteer" to give up his seat for an employee.
It's preseason. Who cares lol
Oh crap....not good!
My man Eli is the best but the game has changed

You're blaming Trump for this!? ... What next, tornadoes kill a minority, and he gets the blame? You're pathetic.
That was beautiful, @RashadJennings . I'll never be a @Giants fan, but love your story. That embrace was priceless!
Doubtful. He's just watching a game
i would not fly with @united after that i bet the guy sues @united
I will never ever again fly on a United flight I will have to change my Airline but that's okay I won't get beat up wanting to get home

United should be bankrupt in 6 months becsuse of no one willing to fly the combative sky's with them. Dint need a boycot just common sense
Out of all bad decisions I have seen companies make this is one of the top 10 ever! I could guide UA better than current ceo
United CEO and leadership all need fired tomorrow. How a management team of such a large company can be so ignorant is unblievable
Imagine how things go when you fly the unfriendly skies

No real details yet. I am sure the world is desperately waiting for some answers!
Or he could have just walked off the plane . The end, no story here.
That's why I fly @SouthwestAir . #united @Marketplace
What do we know about the captain of this flight? Was he condoning this?
NOT FLYING THE FRIENDLY SKIES WITH UNITED
More of a reason @RashadJennings is one of my favorite @Giants https:// twitter.com/emmaslaterdanc e/status/851574160367132672 …
Lmao
69 year old doctor this is sickening
Perfect!
FYI, the @UnitedAirlines twitter handle has been disabled and locked. It was active a few hours ago. Use @united instead. It is support
LMAO
It is a stupid policy
Just like ISIS randomly chooses victims to execute
2 problems the arms look inflated and the jersey is to dark
@Giants fans already knew how great of a human being @RashadJennings is. So glad the rest of the country is getting to see that too #DWTS
Get Casillas the fuck on thru, Jarrad Davis is waiting
Amazing story, beautiful dance; missing you on the @Giants @RashadJennings @DancingABC #dwts
OF ALL PASSENGERS THEY PICK ASIAN COS THEY KNOW THEY CAN GET AWAY W/ IT. IMAGINE THEY DRAG A BLACK MAN OUT,UNITED WOULD BE IN BIGGER TROUBLE
Why victor cruz's #
Probably illegal or sleeper cell anyway
@RashadJennings Great Job on the dance homie sad your off the @Giants But this is where your next step begins #AmazingTalent
That's why I'm thinking standby. Jury is still out.
The @Giants are taking a good look at this upcoming season and it's looking good http:// nyp.st/2o1mX6U via @SMUSportMgt @nypostsports
Gotta luv #the45ths racist america #BoycottUnitedAirlines
That's why I fly American most of the time. I'm not sure I've ever been on a United flight.
Very possible it could've been standby. Haven't heard any real details yet. Maybe this guy could claim discrimination . Y did they pick him?
The friendly sky's that volunteers you to leave the plane for their employees to fly then batter the person and calls them belligerent
Absolutely disgusting. This airline needs to be shut down!
This doctor had a patient waiting for him. He did not deserve to be treated like this. Damn you @united
CEO apologized for “having to reaccommodate these customers.” Really? Company's actions and their response inhumane. #volunteertoflydelta
I voted!!! Go @RashadJennings !
. @Giants were NOT the most injured team for a fourth year in a row; streak snapped, 32nd to 7th! http://www. footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/ 2017/2016-adjusted-games-lost …
Yeah!! Lawsuit!!!
When you have so much money and become so powerful and treat people like commodities it's time to show United who pays the bills. Boycott!!
F United
Right. Disgusting but not surprising anymore.
@Giants Hello any news on the draft day party at metlife? Is it just thursday night day 1 or saturday day 3 as well? Please please.
Looked crazy. First class, next flight, $500.00 voucher, I'm up. I'm betting now, this guy was flying standby.
I miss you more and more everyday @Giants
Thank god I'm a @Giants fan! #lovinglife #GiantsPride
I am sure that united escalated situation & there were multiple personnel there who probably didn't even understand y an assault occurred.
I'm sorry. I mispelled f*ck off.
Police were watching, but the person who assaulted the man looked almost like tarmac personnel.
Nice picture.Brings a tear to my eye!Liked the presentation of u guys on fb.Sue too!
Can do preseason games!!!!
Most likely.
was that because Walker hit Posey earlier?
i already know im gonna get flamed but @JOSH_GORDONXII jersey swap to @Giants pic.twitter.com/1zLsee5CUg
Pay what?

Cops, TSA are more like Security Officers with no powers of arrest.
Wasn't United legging were American an never let them on. Free fliers because of family employee. Violated dress requirement. Pay attension.
They don't want to see us winning @Giants @KodakBlack1k https:// twitter.com/bleacherreport /status/851565159810084864 …
This makes me so upset! That poor man I feel so sorry 4 him
Those were TSA or cops.
He did... he bought his ticket arrived on time was seated then refused to give up his seat 4 a late arriving united employee! #assbeat
Gary:August u gotta go & see the prospects!
Not much choice down here, but there HAS to be more to the story.
explaining the 27 interception and 18 touchdown ratio the year before Odell was drafted lol having one of the best WR helped him a ton
we're still bitter #NeilOdonnell
but every team goes through title droughts. Even the greats
I'd expect that from @Giants fan but I thought @steelers fans had more class #CowboysNation
and we've still won a SB more recently than like 20 of the other 31 teams lol
He should've went Bruce Lee, Jet Li or Jackie Chan on them! Fight or flight! No pun intended!!
It would be a funeral the day Eli left the @Giants @tonyromo @dak @Bease11 lmao @dallascowboys 22 will be 30 years almost the 1st star wars https:// twitter.com/YankeesGod2722 /status/851580728504614912 …

That new beginning can start with @Giants right? :D https:// twitter.com/josh_gordonxii /status/851497884377899011 …
Obviously not hit in the head on purpose. Cheering when a player is hit? Meh

Better let your friends know to use up their miles before United becomes divided.
Life a box of chocolates,,,,
And it was a hand rolled cigar
Me either.
I thought he contributed really well last year , and BJ Goodson is not ready to replace him yet.
Air Canada here, there and everywhere w/Star Alliance airlines for local flights eg Munich Zurich w/Lufthansa. Not that I'm biased
None of whom will ever see another dime of my money.
Ha! Hopefully nice beaches, hot sun, and cold drinks. Cheers!
And remember...Target, Kellogg's, Nordstrom, et.al.
Ya never know where what journey life will take you on Dave. :-)
Well that's not what actually happened with the leggings... With free ride comes rules to be followed. Not the same situation.
My jetting days are behind me, but nonetheless this is useful info for many. And, re jetting days...who knows?
@DWTS @Giants @Jaguars Tune in at 8 to watch our @RashadJennings . http://www. espn.com/video/clip?id= 14247785 …
i have used @united in the past but never again.
Ashamed to be a @Giants fan when they applaud Peralta being hit. That's something tacky @Yankees fans would do. We can win w/o that crap.
Flying in Cda...westjet,,,Europe is Lufftansa,,,lots of leg room..
I don't fly Air Canada either. I use West Jet in Canada and Hawaii. British Airways overseas to London & Israel.
Working late H, will watch you and Ken later tonight
That you're never flying United again is awesome news. Hopefully my modicum of Air Canada stocks will increase in value?
Terrible mishandling! Just TERRIBLE! Rules of overbooking-- whoever gets in the seat FIRST, gets the seat! Right?
With you there one time flying is enough I'll drive.
They're tweeting about odell missing Eli's camp but I've been complaining for years about Eli's participation in preseason games

This poor man! Seeing cops' behavior at the airline's behest (obviously; they didn't send them in with a compensation check) is outrageous!
There are many great Law Enforcement Officers out there and most never have to draw their weapon or let alone shoot someone
Is that how people act in China? Throw temper tantrums?

yes, but I don't think this was the case. Failed to comply, forcibly removed. No gun, taser, club, just dragged off.
Oh yeah.
Anyways I do support Law Enforcement Officers but there are a few bad apples out there not many.
think tha woman in the hiijab 2 rows up "Volunteered" him actually...
Nice!
I take it your not a Military Veteran then other wise you would know what a MOS is
My Military job was Military Police nothing fancy about it I spent most of my time at the Gates
Ima wear a hijab to stay safe
Agree 100% and they should have!!
United could of put its Employees on another Air Lines and saved everyone the trouble.
Steelers, browns, jets y los pats
MOS?
My MOS was 31-B I would tell United Airlines employees to do their own dirty work and I would walk myself off the plane.
Sure, very possible. Notice how everyone quick with their camera phones, but NO ONE quick to stand up and volunteer. Think about that.
Discusting!!! Buh bye United!
pic.twitter.com/pea9NiFEGv
Not all Police Officers would be willing to drag a man off the plane for not giving up his seat. I would tell them to choose another person
Makes you wonder about them having a random passenger generator.
Besides me not liking him if he was indeed smoking weed in that pic then he deserves to get suspended & hopefully cut.
#The4 is on right now on #KTVU . Hope you'll join me & @KenWayneKTVU on this @Giants #OpeningDay .

Already added them to my boycott list. Over charge and over book then offer next to nothing. No takers call the cops.
I am
Stay classy, SF.
Fly Alaska Airlines or Delta Airlines but never fly United Airlines unless your into S&M, free beatings on every flight.
Stop, or I'll say stop again! To what point should one go before using force?
Peralta is HBP and @Giants fans cheer. Interesting that they are happy a player has been hit.
Sign with the @Giants good sir.
put on leave until investigation is typical. He will be back as he did nothing wrong.
Terrible incident.
Boycott @united and sue @united until it bankrupted.
And a wrong way to do the job the Police Officer is not a credit to the men in blue.
Really the Police Officer was suspended after this, hopefully he will be fired for his actions, there is a right way to do this job.
I already wasn't flying United https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4z Oqozo …

The new Airlines .. give them an inch they take a mile on authority...
Me too. Pretty challenging start though.
We got a lot of talent. I want Nick Mangold too.
United has sunk to a new low- terrible for more than 25 years
Will not fly unless absolutely required, I'll drive 18hrs first.
They probably could say he was interfering with the flight, failure to obey flight attendants, etc... imagine the fine print on ticket.
They should go bankrupt over this IMO.

No receiver or quarter back is perfect and both are great athletes

So 28.2 more per year for 5 years gets them to 1000? No problem!
Apparently @united only gets in their "Fly the Friendly Skies" mood, if you live through the beating before takeoff.
Awesome!
Well at least they tossed him before the took off
This is horrible. Poor guy.

@Redskins be sure to post a pic of Eli Manning's hilarious face while getting sacked by a Skin next.
it is sad to see that you guys endorse their company.
@Giants @JohnMaraJr Can you guys drop @united as your partnered airline? Sad to see how they'll treat customers and as a giant fan,
@Giants pick up @LG_Blount @NFL
Eli had two Superbowl rings and MVP awards before the ME guy came along. Will be in HOF. OBJ will be crying about lack of targets all year.
Those TDs were mainly Peyton's. Don't disrespect the goat by putting them in the same category
Peyton's second ring doesn't count

Sorry, no TV for this event.....don't know if it is sold out
@nflnetwork the Brady brothers have five rings
Still more rings combined that the 5head and jethro
Brady has 5
where can we watch?

@Giants Jarrad Davis Round 1!
Looks like VS We'll know at 5 PM @HoustonTexans @Lions VS @Giants
Thanks man! :)
Makes no sense. With a few good years of Eli left and on the bubble of another Superbowl, @Giants MUST add a piece to help NOW.

Well Happy Birthday Stephen!
I was digging for your cards and seems I only have 2. I will post the other in a few weeks
I agree and I guess a happy early birthday Lewis!
Thank you sir! That's awfully kind of you! Take care.
Absolutely! Thank you for the follow back. :)
Well I hope you have a great Bday week. Good men are born in April
So blunt
Thx for the follow!
I hope you have a great birthday sir! It's also my birthday week. My birthday's Wednesday!
Yep. That's my rookie card

I don't know if I've ever seen a more devastating defender in my lifetime, than @LT_56 of the @Giants . #NFL #NYGiants pic.twitter.com/cUoVPyDrPi
Very true. And if Beatty didn't get hurt in 15, he could have developed on a better path too.

l its skip bayless' top 5 under 25 hes a dallas fan #nuffsaid
Best commercial ever lol
@PLeonardNYDN . . . so that the Giants have plenty of ammo to dip into the already much vaunted 2018 QB class?
Preach on brother banks! Landon is gifted
@Giants sign @AdrianPeterson already
I put in an app. They won't return my goddamn phone calls! @giants https:// twitter.com/_Serpic0/statu s/851465510193696768 …
@PLeonardNYDN Which seems more likely for NYG, a 2017 trade-up for a TE or trading away 2017 picks in exchange for 2018 draft capital . . .
I think that's fair. And that's all I was getting at is he's a great player
It's hard for Eli to be in a good commercial it takes his brother to make him look good ...maybe his brother should throw for him too

@Giants Here we go with another Fantastic Season of #SmashMouth Football NFC EAST https:// twitter.com/Giants/status/ 851095179415216128 …
Dak outplayed Rodgers and Elliot did his usual at 21 years old run for 125 yards in the playoffs
But they certainly showed up
Agreed but everyone ahead of him, haven't won a playoff game either.
Evans>>OBj
Perfect List!!
Gotta show up in the playoff games when it counts OBJ was a joke that gm against the Packers terrible defense
Nobody else want him, no market for him. He better take the deal the @giants offered
I like hill he's a great player but he still dosnt have my respect yet just like vick
Yes she was.What he did is indefensible, but that's in the past he's said and done all the right things to show he's a different person now.
Anyone wearing @Giants gear automatically gets a salute from me. #GiantsChat #BigBlueNation

Yes but wasn't she pregnant also? Which would be 100x worse
That would be just unfair.
JPP, OV & MG rotating all game? forget about it.
Could you imagine if the @Giants traded up with the @Browns and got DE Myles Garrett? Moved JPP Inside to DT for NASCAR Defense, wow. #NYG
We are now 2 1/2 weeks away from the 2017 @NFL Draft. Looks like the @Giants could take a LT, OL, DE, DT #Giants #NFLDraft #GiantsDraft #NYG
The short answer is Yes, @sterl_shep3 is capable of being second on the @Giants Anything can happen. We need to protect Eli. #NYG #Giants
Let's Go Champ! #NYG #Giants #BigBlue
Those 3 guys lined up & the new guy @Giants Rhett Eliison, we need a solid LT and we are right there, up tempo offense. Get @AdrianPeterson
This young man @sterl_shep3 is a super star playing with two other @Giants WR mega stars with @OBJ_3 and @BMarshall #GiantsChat #NYG #Giants
There's always a 2nd chance for someone
Why do rookie qbs even qualify? With that line and outstanding offensive players? Too early. Jameis maybe.
She forgave him, we don't. I don't be my woman.
I'm a jags fan and think mariota is better than Prescott watch Prescott not do anything this year too

@theweeknd showing off his new curves while getting on a bus to pride week somewhere is all over @Giants social media explain @JohnnyCueto
Must have no seen him run block then huh, people forget he is a good run blocker
How did Eli give Odell he chance to be who he is? Do you know how ridiculous you sound? Odell was his only target he had no other choice
If odell saved eli's career then Eli gave odell the chance to even be what he is
Do you even watch the games? Odell is a top 3 reliever in the league. TO and Randy Moss were ME guys, didn't stop them from dominating.

He won't be a decoy if he isn't producing, Odell saved eli's career. Eli had the best statistical year of his career in 2015. - giants fan.
Alright Carl, I'm sold. I'm ready for camp. Is it August yet?
good luck with that
pancaked smith in supe 25 ,you never know when a player is gonna develop
carl ,tell some of these fans what you had in jumbo ,he struggled mightily his first 2 years and third year
signing @l_Blount , I know. The @Giants O-Line is straight trash.
What a freaking cowboys lover. Dak is a more mobile Matt Cassel with a good OLine.
Lmfao Winston above bosa & Beckham is a joke just like @RealSkipBayless is.
what talent has Erick flowers shown?I haven't seen it. What I have seen is a scared Eli throwing ball into the ground
Most catches: 1) Brandon Marshall, 2) Sterling Shepard and 3) The ME Guy because Eli will make him a decoy after all his BS.

we won't forget this tweet after the season . hope you're right tho
Idk @CarlBanksGIII his Madden rating dropped to a 66 overall- i think John Madden doesn't like his will... @GasFace76 hahaha
How quickly things change.
So far this can't be argued.
I'm the NYG twitter GM (and O coordinator the season) who has always said he's young and will develop.
Twitter GMs are http:// dabomb.com Carl
I remember when all the @Giants twitter GM'S thought @TheHumble_21 couldn't play Safety and should switch to LB.. 1yr later he's the best!!
Sometimes a guy is just a bust and flowers is a bust
Hey @Giants twitter GM'S never underestimate the will of a talented player.. Ereck Flowers has talent and he has the Will. I'm all in!

After all that Odell has accomplished, this is just sad
Of course. Classic Skip. Next he'll come out with his Top 5 Overrated Athletes and LeBron will be first
Come back to big blue @Giants
Bro u a Beast, I don't want u no where near the NFC East unless with @Giants lol. Would love 2 get a interview if your here overnight #LMK

LMAO Prescott over Winston and Mariota.
No one in my house golfs but they are watching The Masters and screaming like they are at a @Giants game. #missfootballSundays @BobPapa_NFL

it's Skips list , he can put whoever!!
At Disneyland getting dumb love for my @Giants hat I see y'all coat 2 coast
I like Tomlinson better than McDowell and he's a late 2nd too early 5th rd guy
I don't think he even tried
I think Jarrad Davis instantly becomes involved in the defense and becomes a starter by week 4
What are my @Giants doing?
Mariota is probably better than Dak, honestly. I'd love to see what would happen if the 2 switched teams
Let's go Cowboys
Definitely JD!!! Only 2 players would be better 1st rd picks for us "this up coming season" are Cook and myb Howard bc of the offense we run

I like where your head is but zeke should be two just because it is his First year next year with the same or close to sand number he
19th pick was a hit too.
I hope @stephenasmith sees your top 5 Skip. #YoureCrazy Odell>Dak
That's ridiculous it's only 1 season Skip
How can you take Skip seriously? Such a homer? Sorry OBJ is better then Dak, Elliot.
Winston is better than mariota right, but otherwise, yes.
Bosa? Really?
JD all the way Go Gators & G Men
DJ has to be in this group!!
Depends on if we resign Hank.
Vic Beasley
you won't draft a linebacker so who cares?
We went 1-19 without Romo before Dak dawg. You don't know what you're talking about

Facts! pic.twitter.com/VzflfKJFjW
Zeke should have won it
Both QBs here are overrated. Good, but not to Elliott/Beckham level
yes, bosa is the best pass rushing rookie of the era mariota is off and on, still better than dak though
THE DAY IM A @Giants SEASON TICKET HOLDER I MIGHT EVEN KRY OUT OF JOY
Did CC gain 60 lbs in a week @Yankees he could play Dline for the @Giants
No because we can't say Mark has better stats. Mariota has better stats and beat his ass so how is he not better at this point?
Terry Kenard and we could have had Dan Marino im still pissed behind that shit lol.
Giants*
He beat him once out of one. Smoked his ass to be exact. With a shitty line no runnin game and no receivers. Mariota>Winston easily.

Dosnt change the fact he still hit her

@Giants https:// twitter.com/MoveTheSticks/ status/851110689334624256 …
My question is why Dak over Mariota?
Wentz didn't even make the playoffs dude c'mon now
Being left out because of Skip's Dallas Bias
Fraud Fraud Fraud
people say Tom Brady is the product of a system......
Danielle Hunter > Joey Bosa. Do your research...
He's trash.

Not bias at all
1. Odell 2. Zeke 3. Winston 4. Mariota 5. Bosa Dak is not top 5
Odell being under Dak is a joke...Dak being number 1 is a joke...all these players on this list and more are better than Dak
Its Skip Bayless, you cant reason with him
Shuddup Sarah

How bout Danielle hunter 12.5 sacks
1 Zeke 2 OBJ 3 Mariota 4 Bosa 5 Mike Evans
We've only seen Jameis and Marcus one time in the pros we all know what happened.
Shut up. Jameis is not as good as Mariota. Go compare stats then come talk to me.
Winston =
Last time I check @L_Bell26 is 25 but I could be wrong
It's actually Dak Overrated.
*Dak
The only ones who love this list are cowboys fans
At beating woman
Idk probably at his house or something
Your on crack
His oral surgery (dentist appointment) was the equivalent of giving Eli the middle finger. Eli using OBJ as a decoy in 2017 will be payback!
How about vic beasley?
Bosa over Mariota?!
@RealSkipBayless is a homer and can't see past his cowgirls!! I can't wait for the sophomore slump for these two guys!!
@Giants could be a Superbowl contender this year IF they solidify their OL and they're gonna use their 1st round pick on a project QB? NOT!
Dak plays way more technically sound. Wentz doesn't even have correct throwing mechanics. He makes rash decisions like throwin into dbl co.
