I can throw about 37 yards on my knees but if it's a micro football I can get it up to about 52 @Browns
Porque es un ignorante, que no sabe nada de la historia de la NFL, le puede recomendar que en esta vida también es bueno leer libros caros.
#Browns ... How 'bout Lattimore/Conley at 12 Use 52 and the 2nd rounder from Texans to get into the 20s for QB and take bpa at 33? @Browns
The @Browns are getting a steal. That is perfect tackle form. Hope grandma is OK.

My issue with Jimmy G & the Patriots is they are putting way too much effort into letting the NFL know they want to keep him. @browns #lies

Gotta be special to dominate the game from that position... there has been a few
Nothing will ever make a sure thing... takes some more projection... development as with all...

Serious question for @Reflog_18 Assuming @Browns take Myles G #1 Who would you take at #12 ?
I would love to get MH! This guy has amazing ball awareness.
If the @Browns don't take him or trade down at #1 overall, are they making a huge mistake by missing on the most talented guy in the draft?

Trashing your @browns gear after how much they stuck by you? Wow. Classy move there Josh. Thanks for proving me right
yeah because he has potential to be the best WR in the league hahaha they didnt stand by him because they wanted to be a good friend....

Thanks babe
2nd best Hooker has more rang
From a talent standpoint Garrett and Manziel don't even belong in the same conversation. Johnny was also a drunk party goer
Adams or Hooker, can't go wrong! Get aggressive
The @Browns org have done nothing but stick by this player with all his mishaps and this is how he treats them??

I'd take Hooker! Dude will be a big time player in the NFL. Hes fast side line to sideline
chase Yo browns are getting spanked
Come to the @Browns
@TshOw23 biggest sleeper this years draft
2 Ws
Y'all not ready for Glennon the GOAT
2 games vs other bums.
I think he's the toughest SOB in the draft. Brings instant attitude to a defense. Hardest hitter in CFB past couple years

Let me get this straight: @MylesLGarrett initially has no interest in getting drafted by @Browns . Now will make them pay if not picked #1?
Draft him and see

So it's 1-15 again congrats on getting the 1 pick in 2018 NFL draft as well
We already have Dalvin Cook on roster, I hate TE in top 20, so Watson it is...
Some two TE and split Howard out or slot him for mismatch... perhaps
Hard pass. No thank you
Yes...it's called sarcasm
Right, you would do it way more often, but then you play for the @Browns .
We lost: Baltimore, 2008 Week 9, 37-27 @Browns #satisfied #Browns . :(
Ricky's better than the last 26 QBs the @Browns had here. They should sign him but they'll draft another one, ruin him and look for another.
None of it matters until you solve the QB problem.
As sick as I am of seeing the @Browns on the preseason schedule, the 3rd game usually has starters play longer.

@Browns Factory of Sadness
ya probably
Oh now we're cooking with gas @JOSH_GORDONXII @Browns pic.twitter.com/yidb3FAOvC
i've seen your song and dance before and draft day ... in spiderman underoos
With that line of logic, wouldn't that make your opinion irrelevant as well?

Nothing against the top RB's, but if the @Browns take one, 1st overall, I'll be bummed
Trade bum ass josh Gordon
I'm not a browns fan but Jabrill is a bust

Cause he is a bitch
@Browns draft fournette so we can see the fight https:// twitter.com/espnnfl/status /851459468999217152 …
HOW MANY OTHER TEAMS IN THE LEAGUE HAVE NO INSIGNIA - none, uniquely @Browns - never change the helmet
@Browns if you can't pressure the QB he will have a field day against you #commonsense
But the plain, non-logo is so uniquely @Browns , I don't think they should ever abandon it.
Lmao thats the ugliest hat ever @browns
كيف يتجهز فريق كليفلاند براونز للدرافت القادم؟ @Browns مهمة اعادة بناء فريق ادمن الخذلان تقع على عاتق هؤلاء. pic.twitter.com/I59DMaeres
After seeing the awful jerseys the @Browns came up with 2 years ago, is anyone surprised at how awful this year's draft cap is?? https:// twitter.com/kilgoretodd/st atus/851497260802347008 …
@Cianaf Great interview on Cleveland radio. Smart takes. The @browns have quite a conundrum. Take an elite DE or a really good QB? wwyd?
Not for much longer!
those are hideous @Browns smh
Ook so you guys don't want united as a ad partner ever? I'm not mad, just making sure we are all on the same page

They'll trade back 4 times and end up with a guard, a slot wr and a nickel corner. Seen this song and dance before
I like this guy
Disaster Pick. #Browns @Browns @KevLeFlore Draft Garrett or use my Dallas trade picks or similar #NFLDraft RB's are Round 2. Deep class!
Jabril has no ball skills he has shown in game. 1 pick in all the game he played at Michigan. Malik Hooker is a #BallHawk Gimme Malik
good Lord. It looks like something I would buy at a Valero gas station in Pasadena
.....keep swagger tho....that's the homie of homies @browns . But change that dumb little tykes dog logo back to brownie the elf
Perfectly fine with that see my pinned tweet. Lose the dawg. Give us a logo like those pictured in my tweet. Keep the helmet as is
ya who cares what you do on the field.
NO WAY - the @Browns should never change their uniforms (including helmet)-the simple, non-flashy style is a testament to #PaulBrown
@Browns @NewEraCap Draft night hat
@Browns make the dog your damn logo lmao wtf is wrong with you people
We lost: Oakland, 2015 Week 3, 27-20 @Browns #satisfied #PlayLikeABrown . :(
The @steelers have re-accommodated the @Browns a few times over the years.
You right. Then get cut or traded because they suck lol

Myles Garrett AND Trubisky no matter what, @Browns
@browns please https:// twitter.com/browns/status/ 851481332437921792 …
At least it's not just the @Browns . All these hats seem to suck balls https:// twitter.com/patdstat/statu s/851505713213997056 …
Hot garbage. @Browns enough with the dog already. The "Dawgs" was a late 80s thing. https:// twitter.com/nfldraftscout/ status/851508110225231877 …
For a six figure contract I surely would lol.
Do it!
Hey @browns @FEStadium its time to bring em back
your opinion is irrelevant because you associate yourself with @JohnRoth124
This better be in Sashi Brown's pocket right now!! @Browns pic.twitter.com/21KzNTmO6m
Lol yep. PR could not be any worse for this.
great attitude! #Sarcasm
Lol well we are talking nba. I remember Cleveland before Lebron... we are better than that now
You wear jorts, your opinion is irrelevant.
@SECNetwork @Browns @ESPNNFL Charles let it go. Let it go man
We lost: at Jacksonville, 2010 Week 11, 24-20 @Browns #satisfied #Brownies . :(
I agree, unfortunately bc we've stuck by you thru thick n thin unless we can get something 4 u, you play 4 the @Browns or u don't play
I would make fun of this @BleacherReport story on the @Eagles siging McGloin, but I'm a @Browns fan, so .. http:// bleacherreport.com/articles/26878 81-ex-raiders-qb-matt-mcgloin-signs-1-year-contract-with-eagles …
Remember when Modell re-accommodated the @Browns - good times! https:// twitter.com/joethomas73/st atus/851477734119362560 …
@Browns That draft hat should be BROWN, not white. #BrownsDraftCapNeedsTweaking #WhoWorksInMarketing #TrumpWouldFireThem #TheBrownAndOrange
Again to you it's worse. This one is all relative. Neither one of us is gonna convince the other on "pain scale"
Ignorance at its finest
Ur home team leaves, changes their name & the next season wins the Super Bowl. Equivalent of the Pelicans winning the chip same yr. Really??
1. Wasn't CLE first pro team. 2. They were in CLE for 20 years. 3. Four years between their reinstatement and kept identity. It's different
As a @Browns & @OhioStateFB fan, in favor of drafting @MylesLGarrett , I enjoyed @MalcolmJenkins saying MG should have gone to #TheOhioStUniv
When going #1 overall in @NFL draft just ain't worth it. Can we re-accommodate the @Browns marketing staff. #HatsOFF pic.twitter.com/xJahtqVc1Q
@Browns https:// twitter.com/nfl/status/851 461054798409728 …
Jabrill is too good to pass up
Time to get over it. Being mad doesn't change anything. If that's the case don't need those fans. We were glad to get the @Browns back. https:// twitter.com/BringBackTheBu z/status/851502368445300737 …
Barnett is better
To you. It was that level to us and plenty of ppl here.
I hope they take Jabrill instead
Cleveland lost the @Browns they became the Raven & the next season won the Super Bowl. Talk about devastation!!!! Not on that level here
We lost: at Oakland, 2007 Week 3, 26-24 @Browns #satisfied #ParkLikeABrown . :(
Relatable post. The @Browns could be considered the #united of the NFL https:// twitter.com/joethomas73/st atus/851478374438645760 …
Next on the agenda, a dinosaur based dinosaur nickname for MG.
Barnett is better

Ok trade the pick so we don't force anyone to wear this garbage @Browns https:// twitter.com/maximmag/statu s/851491992542597120 …
I like the kid enough that I'll even follow his career if not in Cleveland. But such an interesting, intelligent, & nice dude.
Of COURSE the @Browns prominently featured scrappy doo on the bill of their draft hat. pic.twitter.com/fCsXxe15j8
Okay, I wasn't sold entirely on @MylesLGarrett . But after his morning on ESPN, I'm sold. Come on, @Browns , it's a #NoBrainer #No1Pick
@Browns you HAVE to draft Myles Garrett! Have too
No. Do something good for once dammit
Come Joins Us @Browns for some unbelievable sandwiches and SERVICE! #Sandwich #Food #Fuel #Healthy #Variety #ForksUp #Follow pic.twitter.com/hLYZaYLpLK

he's going to take the @Browns to the SuperBowl
I prefer my wrs to ran faster than my 270 lb DEs
@Browns don't be idiots! Draft Miles Garrett. We deserve a win. Do not trade out of #1!
Why take a kick returner at 12?
Browns will trade down .... watch and see
Just put an SEC Olineman in front of him - he didn't do jack in conference!
Adams
Yes please.
Myles Garrett benching humans on espn @browns
such a damn joke!
Been a few changes and additions recently but this is pretty close to the current https:// twitter.com/DraftRT/status /848269884920406017 …

@Browns how is this acceptable? @NathanZegura can you talk to someone about these? https:// twitter.com/maximmag/statu s/851491992542597120 …
We lost: at Pittsburgh, 2011 Week 14, 14-3 @Browns #satisfied #Browns . :(
@Browns I'll take either one!
Lol knowing pace hes gonna pick allen and im going to die inside. Adams would help our secondary out so muxh
#Browns fans, we are not drafting a RB in the first round, let alone an un-athletic, straight line runner. Signed, @Browns
If @FirstTake is right that the @NFL draft will be legally gambled on in @Vegas , the @Browns will have won the most profitable lottery ever.
Hell no ...... Love it!
I hope you guys don't draft him, I'm a huge LSU fan and I don't wanna have to play him twice a year
Unless a slow white tight end from a catholic high school is blocking me
DO IT DO IT DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!
C) Be a potential HOF part of @Browns ?
No my bears NEED adams
@Browns please don't do anything stupid with this pick... THE CHOICE IS MYLES GARRETT NO ONE ELSE. FOR ONCE DONT MAKE A BROWNSISH PICK.
Lol @Browns
That move would solidify our defense for years to come.
Myles Garrett made an excellent case for why the @Browns better make him the #1 overall pick #NFLDraft http://www. espn.com/nfl/draft2017/ story/_/id/19098554/why-myles-garrett-most-interesting-man-2017-nfl-draft … pic.twitter.com/sBxeIe7ppf
Go with Adams trust
Garrett and Hooker or Howard would be awesome!
fine go the the browns and have fun being the joke of the division
Ready for Brown's to win games....
Your move, @Browns . (via @ESPNNFL ) pic.twitter.com/sVdXFkKwd3
Video is not laughable, this response by the CEO and his choice of corporate wording is very much laughable.
We lost: Cincinnati, 1999 Week 5, 18-17 @Browns #satisfied #ParkLikeABrown . :(
@49ers would love to have Myles Garrett fall to them at #2. Let the @Browns be the browns @richeisen . Lol
Lets hope they make it happen! @browns #cleveland
@steelers have "Re-accommodated" you @joethomas73 your whole @Browns career! Foolish tweet! https:// twitter.com/joethomas73/st atus/851478374438645760 …
Hope you're right
trade up please let's get Garrett and one of these safety's
