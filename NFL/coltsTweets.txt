Well he's 29 years old and not the best locker room guy, so giving up a 1st for him would be tough. I'm hoping we can snag Rueben Foster
I should be a gm lmao
Steelers have 2 3rd rounders they're getting a corner 1st Round anyway so trade that pick for him and a 3rd, 2nd rd they get an OLB
Make it happen! @Colts https:// twitter.com/ProFootballTal k/status/851895666880241671 …
If any1 is interested in getting a backstage look @the US SOF & bravery they have, it opens the 28th @College Park http:// bit.ly/2o0eGAc
No way do you give up our 1st for him.. maybe a 2nd and 4th
Price went down from a 1 and a 3 they still want the 1

ah I see. thank you
Like I said in the tweet, the preseason doesn't count. I don't care if they go 0-4 just speculating.
Luck came back on kc by 28 points with a shabby off line and below par defense in his 2nd year how about that???
Luck will win it all this year
Sherman comes from a zone defense, he's terrible in man coverage. I wonder what scheme we run in Indy? Oh yeah, man to man. He'd be too much
Just being honest @Colts , a @vontaedavis + @RSherman_25 combination would be a lockdown secondary for the ages. But that's "Win Now" talk.
Reddick at 15 would be so fucking bad.
Hey @JimIrsay and @Colts you should go ahead and pick @Haason7Reddick in the first round. Lock it up now. You can thank me later.

can anyone tell me the reason why we play the bengals each year in preseason?
The #Cincinnati @Bengals preseason schedule has been announced. They face the @TBBuccaneers , @Chiefs , @Redskins and @Colts weeks 1-4
I'm not expecting much out of the regular season either.
@Colts
NFL Preseason schedule is out. My annual reminder that @Colts preseason game 4 is the same price as regular season games. @SI_PeterKing
As long as they beat the cowboys
Cannot wait for @colts to realese the regular season dates!!! Come to L.A. already pls
Who cares if they go 0-4 in the preseason as long as the guys can stay healthy that's all that matters lol
That would be insane if they gave you a goal for it. I'd love for the @Colts to give me a shot
@jimirsay any real @colts fans hate preseason games. Please do not promote them. @MikeWellsNFL @mchappell51 @JoshWilsonSB @KentSterling
Lions and Bengals at home in preseason? No way I'll be able to sell those tix, yuck!
The @NFL needs to start painting the field now. @Colts and @packers got screwed last year.
This team historically doesn't do good in the preseason and I'm not expecting any different this year
@kortnimarilyn looks like a possible road trip in August to continue our stadium tour of watching the @Colts at away stadiums! https:// twitter.com/colts/status/8 51541800179441664 …
0-4 or 1-3 bc Bengals kinda suck
Unless we're all of a sudden gods this about to be an 0-4 preseason. Even tho it doesn't count lol.

@RSherman_25 get traded to @Colts !!! We need help out there and you'll work out perfect for us!!
Cool ! But your always will be the Political Button king to me !!
so damn fine
If Jon Hankins asking price gets down to the 7-8mil range, I absolutely think the @Colts should bite. #ColtsNation #NFLFreeAgency #Colts
@MDanely_NFL FYI, I hated the idea of the @colts on hard knocks. So glad it didn't happen. Cameras bring SO many distractions.
Welcome to town! Enjoy our #HoosierHospitality
@Colts Here's a fun fact, the last time I called off of work was 5 days after Reggie Wayne was drafted.
DRAFT HIM @Colts https:// twitter.com/ESPNCFB/status /850785318974377985 …
With so much buzz going with DBs and pass rushers if the @Colts take #BenBoulware in 2nd or 3rd round it's going to be a steal #NFLDraft

@colts don't ask me no questions.. Just draft @Dgriff1000 for my bro A-Luck so he can really get right.

Yeah but he normally is, Int that tend to cost games. He is a good qb but shouldn't be put on a pedestal just yet.
Luck wasn't a turniver machine this year. Less than 1 int per game.
Yeah bc Luck's prime is still a few years away right? @Colts @MikeWellsNFL NO ONE IN THE DRAFT COMPARES TO SHERMAN pic.twitter.com/hUkCchDNe8
@Colts why can't we fly under the radar and grab @RSherman_25 for the other side of @vontaedavis we don't need a first round pick send that

I must say that I'm quite impressed by the amount of media content that the @Colts produce ALL YEAR LONG.
Both @Broncos Super Bowl winning QBs were drafted by the @Colts .
That should start with "Once upon a time", & end with "They all lived happily ever after". Same as the @Colts

@RSherman_25 I've been a fan of yours on & off the field. Your talent & impact on my @Colts roster would be immeasurable. Pls consider.

Luck is way to low. Stafford ahead of him . Luck has already had a better career than him.
Love the show but the next draft expert who says the Colts should go RB in round 1 needs to be dropkicked.
@List10bee_Swagg , we expect you next. @buffalobills
How many didn't make the top 50?

Wow my bad, mind going thanks for clarifying.
James, are we talking about you? Edgerrin James maybe? Either way, we can confirm neither of you were drafted No. 1 overall. (Edge was 4th.)
Gotcha. Smith is 6'2, 315 according to his bio. Wish I had some agility numbers or more tape though.
How does James not make this list.

Awwww
@Colts Better grab Richard sherman while he on the market
Not just any NTs, some monstrous NTs. Stewart is 6'5" 300 lbs.
As he should be! #18

@colts go sign Adrian Peterson , but you better not pay him no more than 6-8 mil

I think so. Dimitrius looks to be JR's younger brother but I'm not sure.
The @Colts should try & get Sherman
If I were Chris Ballard & the @Colts I'd trade for Richard Sherman in a minute! He has what we need! #Toomanyniceguys #needpissnvinegar
The feeling is mutual.
@dandakich @ProducerKyle no worse fit in sports or life in general than @RSherman_25 to the @colts . No drama city and weak coach

Who should the @Colts take in the first round of this up coming draft
@Colts please sign Jonathan Hankins and draft Haason Reddick.
I remember watching the Dorsett draft pick on TV. I feel like nobody at the time even thought that pick made any sense. Lol
Cannot wait. Football season begins April 27th, my bday
Future @Colts RB, falls to right about when we'll take our RB

As I said it's not a dire need, but it is a need. Grigson set up back at least a few years with bad drafting an millions in Free agent flops
And I loved the Aiken signing. He's got a huge chip on his shoulder. Dorsett is an absolute bust. Another Grigson fuck up
Tell.
Believe me He's not better then ok. But he has the potential to be a top ten 10 WR. Can he be more consistent and stay healthy? Time will

@HoustonTexans Ha, 2017 Season is a bust for u guys. No QB out there. @Titans or @colts will win AFC South. Savage should b spelled Salvage.
Probably hasnt signed anything theres still time. If not you could hire me cheap. Guaranteed 40+ ppg w AL never under center. Shotgun/ only
Not this year... but we'll send you some gear to make up for it. Follow @coltspromos and they'll get your info!
Sounds like he's got a pretty solid job with CBS lined up.
Top of the list of favorite Colts! He lived his message.
@Colts hire @tonyromo as offensive coordinator
Adrian Peterson WILL play for @Colts this season

Lmaoooooooo
Colts spent $12 to ship a drawstring backpack, swag, a personalized letter, and last year's team yearbook.(same kind the bolts sell for $10)
most sent fan swag back(team photo, stickers, lanyards, temp. tattoos)...with a canned letter assuming i was a fan already.
Don't hate on #ShoeNation
Can't wait to see the Colts in Bowling Green KY. Whoops, not on list
lol you right

I got 9 responses and colts was the best
Nothing so far lol
I'm glad my team is the least likely to ever leave its city
Circle of life
And your results?
One day the LA Chargers will choose some soul who lost the Jaguars or Bills or something.
But they chose me, i just went with best offer
But kind of ironic that you chose a team that left its city to replace your team that left its city
I like the choice.
I started following football after I watched Marshall Faulk play at SDSU and became a Colts fan for a while after they drafted him.
I did this too lol

Patriots consistently beat Manning-lead @Colts , thats enough to earn my undying love
Right. Gotta mean we plan on getting one in the draft. But if we got him that's flexibility in the draft. Could go corner pick one then
I'm going to lose my shit if we don't find a stud ILB in draft and we could've gotten Zach Brown for practically nothing
We got $31 million in cap. $31 million!!! We better not regret this.

Adrian Peterson would look great in an @Colts uniform.. And I'm sure Andrew Luck would appreciate it..
Baker would be your guy. @LanceZierlein actually compares him to Bob Sanders if I remember correctly.
The question should be do you have an offensive line to protect Luck to get the job done.
How's Andrew Luck health? @Colts head coach Chuck Pagano filled us in at the owners' meetings: https:// siriusxm.us/2oqiiMj pic.twitter.com/bC1wfOIl9i
Which one offers the most attitude and would give the @colts the "bad boy" mentality on defense?

Ah, yep. Looks like it. Good for him.

Any of those 3 will do!
We did that last year. Development taking place. O line will be fine. Defense is nearly worst in NFL
Yes for on air (with credit to @Colts ). Please embed the Tweets for any online use!
please @JaYbOi225 we needed a pass rusher
Check out JuJu Smith as well @Colts
Ballard has a great football mind, he'll be able to get good quality impactful players in the later rounds.
Colts need help every where, just about every position besides Wr and Qb of course. So as long as they get a top O line or D, I'd be happy.
