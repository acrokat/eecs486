OH YEAH and you got Jerry Rice in the GOAT @AntonioBrown @steelers
Josh and Marty is like having Moss and T.O. @steelers
I would then comply with the cry baby's wishes [Roethlisberger] and make an offer for Josh Gordon @steelers @browns - #105 and 2018 2nd
I wonder if the @steelers would consider the @browns plea of adding another 1st rd pick and would accept #52, #65, #145 for #30
I should be a gm lmao
Steelers have 2 3rd rounders they're getting a corner 1st Round anyway so trade that pick for him and a 3rd, 2nd rd they get an OLB

This is our time we got close the last 3 seasons its our time to wins a super bowl LETS GOOO STEELERS

Honesty, Integrity and loyalty are no longer the Hallmarks of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Arians, LeBeau and Polamalu are examples
Troy was never cocky either. Can't take away these new guys are good, but their attitudes stink. All about the $$$$.

He shouldve been honored and permitted to go out his way. How do some people sleep knowing they mistreated and disrespected an honorable man
There'll never be another Troy Polamalu. Ever. This was a very gifted athlete and in the top 3 of my fav all-time Steelers. #respect #love
he was so loyal he could've played for another franchise. But chose not to. He will go Into the HOF a Steeler, franchise is undeserving
You mean forced in retirement man said he would play for free he loved it so much
Yay Ben

He's living proof of the disloyalty the Steelers have practiced the last couple years. The once honorable franchise can be a disgrace
Reading all of the responses in this TL and I wonder to myself. Are @steelers fans born w/o a sense of humor or is that developed over time? https:// twitter.com/joethomas73/st atus/851478374438645760 …
the way they treated him, made me ashamed be a Steelers fan, everything they preach is hypocrisy. They destroyed the meaning of loyalty
You: 48-112 + extended off-seasons Him: 105-54-1 + 2 SBs @steelers You're a HOFer at football, but not so good at choosing photos.

Steelers treated him like garbage at the end. Nice way to treat a guy who was dedicated, played the game with heart and soul. Disgraceful
Saddest day ever! my fav! @steelers @tpolamalu https:// twitter.com/steelers/statu s/851420729920942080 …
Our defense still hasn't recovered
You mean the Steelers forced him to retire and handled it with no class, to a player who played his heart.
It was
Top 5 O-Lines of 2016: 5. @AtlantaFalcons 4. @steelers 3-1. http:// on.nfl.com/8WBlWf pic.twitter.com/fgxuA6JIRe
Thanks for forcing him to retire @steelers sometimes I question what the hell you all are doing.
The @steelers have re-accommodated the @Browns a few times over the years.
Good talk.
when troy polamalu was forced to retire*
one of the all time greatest. Humble off the field and a lion on the field. #43 #HOF
I miss this guy. One of my favorite players in the history of the NFL.
Miss the best safety ever
Totally agree. It was a sad day.. Best athlete in the league.
. @steelers almost as tight as @TwentyER https:// twitter.com/steelers/statu s/851507886735982592 …
Proud to have him as a FOREVER STEELER
I died that day

Very nice. Training camp is my favorite time of year, see you there
Do you think putting a my jersey with my name between 2 future HOFers is a little arrogant?
Very nice!

Thanks very much , what's the difference in some them been $99 and $149 dollars ... what's the difference in the jerseys
My custom @steelers @SteelersUnite jersey came in today. #snuproud we will be at Training Camp before you know it! pic.twitter.com/64wC958ALA

Wow, Revelation!
My favorite all-time Steeler. My license plate and handle is ST43LERS because if him.
La frase "Here we go" se usa solo cuando @steelers tenga un game day
Here we got number 7
Kansas City meets Philly. Probably inspired by @kcchiefs vs. @steelers . Or @Royals vs.… https://www. instagram.com/p/BStulzxBwYj/
loved when @Steelers #JackLambert "reaccommodated" @dallascowboys Cliff Harris
will we ever see him again?
@steelers -Shit I wish chad johnson wanted to still play we could use him. Him and AB#84 are friends. They work out together.
@steelers and how bout looking at another back to keep Bell#26.Legs fresh.need two work horses not just one Keep him ready for the playoffs.
#LymeAwareness plea of the day: @steelers & @Eagles could you do your state a solid & take @LymeChallenge - Pa has most Lyme cases in nation pic.twitter.com/wSZ9FXW8kH
@steelers -What about. Getting Kapernick. To back up Ben. Shit We Had M.Vick. and that worked out. Should have kept him. Gotta keep #34 also
@steelers Plus, Pouncey has been in trouble (see Aaron Hernandez) and part of the real reason Urban left. #think
@steelers Vegas trouble? Welp, it IS the CBA the players signed and they ARE the rules. No less lame than celebration penalty - but a rule.
@steelers -so we need to add on like the #PatsNation ..Role players and a great off. Line to protect Ben..
Sons of guns can't leave him alone. #FireGoodell #corruptNFL - @steelers should protest by taking a knee anytime Goodell opens his suck.
Best Super Bowl return EVER!!!!!!!
Miss him so much

@steelers (Rooney's) should pay the fine the players are going to get for them going to a charity event. It's charity!
May of lost the war, but won the battle.
oh gosh...what a joke. The only reason the NFL is so popular is ... http:// tmi.me/1fif44

Please trade a few picks & get him! I would gladly give up our first 2 picks.
@steelers why are y'all not pursuing Richard Sherman. I wanna win a super bowl next year.

Sad Day
When retire i believe they should retire #7.I dont think anyone is worthy o that number
I'm a niner fan but wow was he a good player
the goat
Right ! Those loses still hurt
Y que bueno!! En todos mis años (más de 30) viendo americano! No había visto un jugador tan mal intencionado y mala leche como èl!!!!
even loss to GB in SB just one db short
you're right go back a little further loved those dudes but towards the end ? Loss to teebow in po's
Happy to help.
We hands down have the best offense in the NFL but we need help on D , Sherman solves our biggest problem on defense
Fake news bro lol
The best CB in the league isn't worth it? The guy who can help us defeat the patriots and win SB isn't worth it
Nah, just the power of Google knows no limits lol
Didn't even know that, you're a better Steelers fan than me I guess
Not worth it .
Yeah they're not lol but mel has a son named akil blount that plays for the steelers
Also we have 19 mill in cap space currently
Happy Birthday Mel!!You're an all time great !!
Our 1st and 3rd round picks, We have better picks then Pats and Seattle are talkin to them about picks, we can easily do this
Yeah no trading AB , couple picks though YES
Who are you trading for him and what current players are you not paying next year!!!
Right ever since Troy and Clark and Taylor left we been starving in the secondary, why not get the biggest piece of steak on the market
Don't think so lol
@44down Happy birthday
He related to legarette?
He's allowed 12 tds in his career! ! , we have 19 mil in cap space, and we have LB , James Harrison, and Mike Tomlin, he fits perfectly
Important aspect of FO projections: offense easier to project than defense or ST. Big reason @Steelers do so well. http:// es.pn/2nTGLrT
He is an absolute legend!!
:(

Don't remind me pic.twitter.com/SqTo70q2rX
Over rated, too expensive, and not a personality fit for this team .
Look, up in the trees... It's a bird, it's a plane... No, it's Superyinzer!
They weren't saying trade AB , they're saying trade periods, Seahawks only want picks
Man I miss this dude!
@steelers figured it out
Gimme one reason why we shouldn't
You sure? All 2016 our biggest issue was CBs getting burnt considering we're looking to draft CBs anyway why not trade picks for the best?
Should still be playing smh
@steelers https:// twitter.com/bleacherreport /status/851445720053927940 …
He's definitely a Steelers Great #FreeMartavis
cause y'all made him

He's the only guy on the planet whom I would be nervous to meet. I'd probably get the same feeling as when I met Pres. Reagan in 1998.
And the team needs to get him back in the fold. Don't need him to play but he was done wrong for him not to want to be around the team
Lost respect for @AntonioBrown . I'm a huge @steelers fan but just goes to show he's just a

@steelers trivia question what was the name of the player to score the very first touchdown in Steelers(Pirates)history?
Mean Joe Greene said it best: Focus needs to be on winning SB titles, not twerking, rapping and social media #FinalWord
Take the headlines away from the players who do dumb stuff in the off-season. Maybe to get those guys to realize window is closing now?

To send a message to the team & franchise that he's getting ready to hang em up so they better get it together & win a SB before he's gone!
nah we good
trade AB and secondary wont be the only weakness
Yes
spur of the moment type talk where he said something when he really wasnt intending to retire

With a quarterback that doesn't have the heart anymore, you'd be better off with romo

Playoff frustration. Hard 4 champ to see his team dominated with no answers. He had to be thinking is it worth abuse? Friends retired too.

I think he was just angry over the AFC Title loss to New England, and took longer than needed to say what he and we already knew.
To let the team know that he does not have many more years left. He wants to win now before he is done or replaced. To get a back up

Well they have a point, trade DRAFT picks for Sherman we'll be set, Steelers only problem is the secondary, Sherman would solve that
