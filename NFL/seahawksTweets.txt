The @Seahawks would never pay the contract he had with them.
@Seahawks @PeteCarroll @Seahawks247 PICK UP SAM SHIELDS!!!
Bruh you do realize these Oakland natives are mad about them moving to LV? You boutta catch hands too
Sad that he wouldn't consider the @Seahawks
Played both WR and DB in HS. Wanted to play in college, but couldn't because of scholarship rules. Great speed and size for height. Good
of course bud
Raiders!!!!!
O yea big brudda

Report: @RSherman_25 asked @Seahawks to trade him http:// a.msn.com/01/en-us/BBzxz bk?ocid=st … Watch his value drop. He will be taught a lesson. Loud Rep #NFLPA
Peppers is not the solution overrate and no true position fit, several possibilities at DE and CB in early rounds
What do you think the solution to finding help on defense? I'm really hoping to get @JabrillPeppers , more pieces to fill after that as well
@Seahawks if you guys end up trading @RSherman_25 your defense will collapse
Hey @Seahawks do you recognize the colors in this campaign logo? The 12s are everywhere... https:// m.facebook.com/Keep-Judge-Eve rett-1811459065842574/ …

@Seahawks trying to lose weight in the middle of the playing season is dangerous. I don't see how this ends well.

I look at this & all I see is your pompoms lol no honestly #BUCKETLIST item is to own a pair of these #12
tEXACTLY the long DB @Seahawks love. In this video, you see him always away from the WR. He gets tied up easy in press, great in zone.
Love this pic @SeaGalBronwyn @SeaGalTrinity @SeaGalSade @SeaGalKylie
I'll be there. It's my first time at this run or any other running event!
Who's heading to the @seahawks 12k at The Landing tomorrow?! See you there! pic.twitter.com/B0DgQag3Q7
