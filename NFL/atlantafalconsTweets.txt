Im just saying I dont see him bringing a ring home to ATL. So much talant. No sweat Im sure mgmt will keep him around. That and his contract
He's the best QB talent wise since Bartkowski. Players at that level don't come along every day. He's not the first QB to flounder in the SB
I'm sure not big deal
The Eagles have the same amount of Super Bowls as the Falcons

for ryan then we would not have even made it to the superbowl
are we talking about the same guy? he was MVP for christ sakes and he set career highs and led the offense onto a historic run. If it wasnt
Just hope you guys don't give up the lead. Hold on to it. Rise up
Too bad Matt Ryan ain't the answer. To bad @juliojones_11 will never get a ring, unless he signs with @Eagles . @Dmek18
H's great on paper! Hes no leader, &for the last 2-3ys its not for lack of talant! He cant get the job done,move on. I dont need a P.Rivers.

When the Saints lose Brees to retirement Saints will be the new Browns. Sorry not fucking sorry.

As far as I see 3 easy wins and a possible chance at having the Patriots be the only team Ryan hasn't beat. Love this preseason
Hahahaha that would be hilarious
OMGGGG IF I EVEN GOT THE CHANCE TO MEET JULIO I might physically pass out!! Haha
Definitely...I have to get a pic with Matt and Julio too lol

I don't think that because they won. I think that because I feel like they have just s bit better team. Defense is good and got weapons
Well, 28-3 joke is dry asf, because no one likes ur tweet. U just embrass urself every time
No you dummy read it over
Even if they were yall still blew a 25 point lead in a quarter soooo
Did u just say no remembers the golden state blown lead? Are u new to twitter? 3-1 is way more popular than 28-3

True that!
10-6 actually isn't bad actually but I'll expect at least a 11-5 season from them
Trufant was hurt
Against the goat coach and qb. It happens. Falcons are young and inexperienced. Atl will be back sooner than later
ahhhh so proud of you babe!
Alrighty then. Rise up
Considering almost every starting (except 3) had 2 years or LESS of experience on ATLs SB defense. They will obviously get better
Brady played well against 4 rookies starting on defense in the SB. Big deal. ATL had the youngest d in the NFL. Learning experience

10-6? Naaah lower.
can you read? i just said i'm 78
@AtlantaFalcons Your main goal this season is to make touch downs after half time if your in the super bowl. But your not GOING.

Nigga go play 100 snaps of NFL football and tell me you wouldnt be gassed -_- btw season average was 63 snaps
Hey. How are you doing? How was your weekend?
But more importantly they have to be good, skilled, "STRONG " and have a serious willingness to learn and win.
Lol wat....that shit gona be hella interesting to see play out
There was literally no way he could've intercepted it. It was a great play just to swat it.
Focus primarily on DL and get some strong & fast DE's on both sides of the ball. Two additional OL's would be nice too.
@AtlantaFalcons how many RTs to get a tour for the camp and to meet @Mo_12_Sanu

Decided to take a look at @AtlantaFalcons new home. Unreal! @RKR1977 @BryceRobinsonqb @Bayleigh0613 pic.twitter.com/SzekadeJSy
Gronk most likely wouldn't have made big fucking difference. Our defense crapped out
or if we had gronk. Lot of shoulda woulda coulda. Bottom line is we win, falcons lose
Maybe take an O-Line to replace Chester
Go for it @AtlantaFalcons he can make vic even better https:// twitter.com/FalconsViews/s tatus/851438054384570368 …
ICEMAN!
Our secondary i ain't worried about. Get some help on the D-Line. We got a ring
Oh yea, for sure.
Nah we repeating
He definitely stepped up big time. I love him I'm just saying before Trufant went down he pulled some PIs
We will be back within next 3 years. Need to build a little bit better D-Line.
I died when he swatted it. I was like 99% sure it was over. That drop killed me
@richscrambled
Since he got his extension, he's played lights out.
He had been flagged only once or twice in a span of 7 games after Trufant went down/he got paid.
He has some off days. Too many Pass Interfence calls
Yeah he swatted at it instead of catching
I haven't seen anything from the @AtlantaFalcons about guess the schedule this year
If Vic got that last one
Visiting with @AtlantaFalcons today before heading back to #Florida @tigerrugby @WorldRugby pic.twitter.com/NZs2TTq9MM

That's fine. Thanks for beating Carolina.
25 point lead ur franchise is a joke
Well, clearly, Trufant wasn't playing......
Ever since he got paid he's played great.
nice
delete the real no fly zone would never give up a 25 point lead in the biggest game of the year
Thats OK. At least our teams didn't mess the bed on the biggest stage like the @AtlantaFalcons did. #CoachMuch ?
Now everybody that hasn't played a sport since high school can become a pro in said sport years later? Sign me up.
@cambeastyoung01 I don't see brady on here

Oh it's not random to me lol. I'm just trying to draw attention to the tweet
random, I know.
28-3
@AtlantaFalcons ?
@AtlantaFalcons check ya DMs
Game would've been different with Trufant or the 3-4 fucking INTs we dropped
@Broncos are No Fly Zone
at least until there are 10 minutes left on the clock in a big game
It's hard to find good players, but both of them together? Watch out now, danger lurking. Rise up
Trufant is a beast but Alford plays poor some days. If he was consistent it would be better
Glad that Alford has been improving would like to see him work on less PI's but he's been ballin out since Tru was hurt.

What y'all know about that
you must not have had a good childhood if you don't understand that reference
Damn If the Houston Texans had Matt Ryan we will finally win a Superbowl and Ryan would have Rings!!
idk what team would recover being up 25 points in the biggest game of the year. What a choke job lmao
Not really. You're from Atlanta but you don't understand that the team that usually loses the super bowl most likely won't recover
Kap would piss off Texans, but I'm all for it and would buy the jersey.

Alford & 3rd/4th for Sherman @AtlantaFalcons makes sense to me
@TheFalcoholic That would be LOCKDOWN on the outside while Keanu & Allen patrol the deep/ middle
so... lets be real. Alford isnt even in the same CLASS as Sherman. Did you even consider a scenario w/ Tru & Sherm together? @AtlantaFalcons https:// twitter.com/thefalcoholic/ status/851147720521809921 …
This is close enough.
