Except this is a very thin draft at DT lol.. Edge rushers, yes. Defensive tackles, not at all

This also has Fournette available at 21 and @Lions not taking him, which is nonsense, as Zack Zenner was our leading rusher in 2016.
@jswaggdaddy man im so inspired by your story and what you've gone through. Im a fan of the @Lions and they need a RB and man like you.
Come on @Lions this kids the steal of the draft! Mark my words Jamaal Williams is the next AP! #FREAK #RUNANGRY https:// youtu.be/tubrdY1jr8o
Gonna see you guys at the Buffalo game, hopefully.
@Lions if there is one runningback you should take it's Jamaal Williams out of BYU. The kids a beast and has his head on straight #NFLDraft
Thanks guys god is going to richly bless you for your help.

Then go
The @Patriots play the @Lions in the preseason and I would do anything to go to that game
But isn't Spence another 5 tech? We really need depth at the 3, even w/Ngata, and I'm not sure AShawn is best served at that inside tackle.
Please @Lions do NOT draft a tight end round one. #please

yeah I see your point but I think Quinn is here to build a dynasty and When Tom leaves it'll be anybody's league
what's even the point anymore, Pats are like America and every other team is like a 3rd world country in a war
Yeah me too but for the right price is the issue
I just wish they would pick up one more big name player
Could you imagine Sherman and Slay at the corners for @Lions
Good on you, Ameer! But, wouldn't it be amazing to see a portion of ticket sales donated to the #Flint cause by the Ford family?

The Bills are in a 17 year playoff drought. This is the 16th straight preseason we play the @Lions . We just need a #Lionless preseason.

I flipped a couple offers of CT plus a 2018 3rd for low-mid 2017 2nds. See if anything comes back.
So blessed to have spent $900 on preseason games to not see the @Lions and @Bengals Thank you @Colts and @NFL

maybe i'll switch it up and fly out for a @lions preseason game this year. gotta see that new @fordfield ASAP!
Fine, I've doubts offer will be accepted but Thomas was a decent injury fill in RB in a PPR league for me and I'd want to hold on to him.
Browns.
. @Lions host NYJ & NE in Weeks 2-3 before closing out 2017 preseason at Buffalo. DET & BUF have met in preseason finale every year since '02
The risk is whatever you have paid.

Just on a player-comparison level, seems like AA a better player, but on a situation/opportunity level, CT may be a better option.
That's it!! Winning football men! This is all we know! If you're not about winning, we don't want you in the D !!

Get players back from injury fast asf
Listen I will never let a player keep his injury secret like levy I will be the best physical therapist they have ever seen
go to school sports therapy lol next Ernie kander
On god if I could choose 1 profession that's not a soccer player Its being on the lions staff
lions gonna invite us in the war room now lol
If you buy low what's the risk?
I like him too
Derek Barnett from Tennessee is the real deal
I want Taco
You can never have to many edge rushers
Haven't seen enough production on the field to guarantee him keeping his job. Question remains whether this 5'9' 190#guy is every down RB.
We only really need 2 honesty one of the fa signings we had on d line gonna wow some people .. just watch out
that's all I want
For 7 rounds I want DE
Eat Thomas would be good anywhere. He is the only exceptions
me neither I want de
That man is a stud just a great player
I like the kid from Uconn more then them all but I wouldn't draft a DB first round
they play on Seattle. Exactly what I said. System
I like Buddha baker more then peppers
BOBAN and ellenson should have started since day 1 would be a top team in east with them
I don't think peppers is those guys at all
not many are gonna disagree with you lol
So Earl Thomas...you wouldn't want him? Peppers is even bigger. Kam Chancellor has 12 CAREER picks...those are top flight safety
lmaooooooooo
Sorry to interfere here but ummm who has seen the level of greatness BOBAN is at rn , better than Drummond
he just a lb stuck in a db body to me
@RealMattlanta Michigan State & scUM fans say same things about @Lions
I'm not buying it either but not foolish enough to invest in Ameer before the draft and then get burned when it turns out rumors were true.
if peppers was 25 lbs heavier I would want him
I just think peppers overrated
Bob Sanders couldn't cover and he won defensive POH
Let's say we DO draft him would it really be the worst? Quinn covers everyone and Peppers loads the box. Same shit like when we had Ihedigbo
I think he was moved to lb cause he can't cover
Abdullah was a high 2nd rd pick. Other than tearing his Plantar What did he do on the field to lose his job?
he was asked to do a lot. NFL coaches will teach
It's draft season there's a lot of rumors like CLE taking Fournette at #1, don't mean it's real or I'm buying it.
he's a tweener that's why I say no. Great KR/PR
he never covd anybody in college
I like peppers just he a lb stuck in safety body
with his speed he can cover any TE
he played safety a full year and got torched
Once again I don't want to draft him but I definitely think he will make a fine living in the NFL
All I'm saying is how do we know that. He was never put in a position to cover anyone. He played Lb a majority of the year
Yup, I hear talk of @Lions taking Mixon or another highly ranked RB that falls to them. Abdullah's job is not safe, see Tre Mason pre Zeke.
peppers a g in college just can't cover man
no but made more plays then he did in detroit
He's not a star
look at Kyle van noy lol
I don't think so
he would be a star in Seattle or patriots
Overrated
do not touch peppers trust me
We have to make Rodgers eat shit twice a year...we own them we own the division
And we play nickel mostly. Only need two LB
That's my boy. Back on the winning train
I didn't say DB, I said DE
We lacked Lb's when we had the second best D in the league. Everyone looks better with a sick line...ask Seattle
DE Derek Barnett out of Tennessee
You would say DB first round. Ha kuku what happened to you Rok
we lack LB's. We need that in the middle but DE works
DE-LB-DE-DT-LB then idc
I want neither. I legit would go 7 rounds of all edge rushers...we play Rodgers 2x every year...break his face
they are the center of your defense for years. Hope im wrong
Big time and with foster in trouble Quinn will shape his ass up
I doubt that Steve. Multiple running backs could go in the top 20, plus the mix of QB's I could see one falling to us
Honestly seems like a great pick
not cause he's mich but I love
We will see
they won't drop to 21. Both going top 15.
Or go DE first round then draft Raekwon mcmillan second round
Him or foster is gonna drop just a matter of which one
would love reddick to bad he's gonna go top 10. He's a beast
Haason reddick or zack Cunningham
2 for 2 young man
All I know is #TheQuinnEffect
Now you're thinking with your dipstick...draft young dudes for cheap
Where * not getting me this time rrock
Cuz a sneeze will put him out...if he doesn't put up numbers this years its a easy move #JavidBest2 .0
Ashawn Robinson is were it's it
Abdullah is a dog idk why people hate on him 5.6 ypc before injury
Still no. Hgata is more then serviceable for a fraction of the money
Shit we won 9 games with those dudes. Healthy backs and we are straight on offense with that dog ass line
Gerald McCoy
Tate and marvin good by them selves ? Oh ok
I would NEVER give an interior linemen big money....ever, ever, ever
I'd welcome him with open arms tbh we can't act like he was not productive
Plz god no.
At least 1 wr in first four rounds u have too
Stop you were the same person who wanted to resign Suh #SwingAndAMiss
Now you're talkin my game...D Line and LB
Edge rushers until our face falls off
I want the linebacker from temple
It means nothing. I'm sorry but it does.
If he fit the Lions need 1000000% I want them to draft McDowel...not in the first but I want him
No cuz he's not a good player in my mind great athlete tho
stay away from Malik
Just answer this....would you want him if he went to state? Fuck no
Only yours Steve. Are we gonna act like J Booty ain't get hurt in that useless game?
Neither will I
No, just not him.
How bout we leave it at this.....we can have this convo a year from now. I won't forget
A majority of guys in any draft won't make it? Should we draft no one?
Spartys kinda like Libs these days tough taking those Ls
My man played Lb in the big ten at 5'10 200 lbs
Lotta guys go in first....and don't make it
Cuz americas is amazed by his athleticism not complete player , their are wayyy better corners and safeties and linebackers then him ...
He's going in the first for a reason? Like what don't you get...regardless if you want him too or not...sorry but stop the hate
Let the country in tackles for a loss anyone
Finished 4th in the Heismen as a defensive player...good enough for them? Good enough for me
Not grown man talk it's stats
And stop listening to the mayocks, they don't know everything. Think for yourselves
get adoree' jackson @Lions
U wanna explain what he's done I'm all ears
He's in the first round cause of versatility and flat out athleticism. The guy is sick athlete, but he's not complete at any one position
And? Lmfaooo stop Mateo this is grown folks talk
My Gyshie could have caught it lol
Of a tip that was made by a teammate #Nextttttttttt
I pray not for us.
If he wasn't a safety he wouldn't be projected on the first round? Like all these teams are wrong? Come on man
He's spot on, dude! he answered your question plain and simple and you go spouting on about arguing? Lmao get a life
He's a tweener, should focus on playin RB/SLOT
Maybe not for us but somebody for sure, sorry
He's not NFL safety, sorry
Change that subject Rok, just like you good at
His only pick was against OSU? #Nextttttt
You guys the same ones that wanted trey Burke. Let it go
Mateo...handle my light work
You guys are just Michigan lovers. And FYI NFL evaluators are seeing him as offensive player, more and more
Bottom line is he's overrated didn't produce like he had to and really was no existent in huge games , but best of luck where every he goes
Sign him @Lions https:// twitter.com/bleacherreport /status/851505499140792320 …
Thank god you're an NFL talent evaluator cuz they got him in the first round
@Lions we MUST take a chance on @JOSH_GORDONXII !!!!!! The man can PLEASE
He's not an NFL safety. End of story
False.
He played safety last year
Bob sanders also only lasted 3 years
Slowed him down??? From what? 4.44 to a 4.40? He was fast as fuck. He cannot cover! End of story
He didn't quit on his team he got hurt 2 days before the game #muchadoaboutnothing
We do need a safety. And I'm talking about when he covered as a safety. I seen him get beat a lot. Like lost on assignment
Bob Sanders won defensive play of the year not covering a soul...I know football
That was pre game
Safeties still gotta cover, can't just be run stopper. I watch, I know football. He should be playing offense if you really wanna know
How do you know Rok?He never lined up at CB, played a fake position the whole year. I think he's gonna be a stud we just don't need a Safety
Nope, I watched mom get torched....a lot. Bad mfer in the box, not in coverage. Like at all
No way buddy, he couldn't cover college WR. NFL he'd get torched bad
I think he can. That versatility hurt his draft stock more then helped, I think. If he played CB or Safety all year it woulda help him
I don't want him as a Lion cause he can't cover anyone.
Gregg, without all of the injuries do you believe the DRW qualify for the post-season?
I don't want him for the lions either but when you don't get paid what's the point of the bowl game? Jbooty is your prime example
He was crying? So he either put on the best acting job of all time or he was hurt.
Jack of all trades; master of NONE
man, seems like rash of End of Eras on #Detroit sports scene, last 12 months. could @Lions actually start... oh, NEVER MIND!
Improving the O-Line and drafting an RB to compete with DWash and Zenner will happen though.
Lions have many needs a feautre RB isn't one right now. Abdullah will get another year to show. When healthy he's put #'s.
Draft this boy
No way @Patriots will bring back Blount if Lynch comes back to play for them. @Lions should consider signing Blount if this goes down. https:// twitter.com/jeffphowe/stat us/851476533235658752 …
Maybe because there are some who think the @Lions might take a highly rated RB in the draft? https:// twitter.com/JayChasJohnson /status/851488284559540224 …
DRAFT HIM
This pick would be amazing, but in all honesty we need to go after Reuben foster
Breaking news former @lions Titus Young sentenced to 4 years for a street fight that occurred in… https://www. instagram.com/p/BStzAN1AAOa/
He never comes off the field! He plays ss in base defense and lb in sub packages. He is the best return man in the draft
You all either know nothing about football or have never seen him play! He would be a home run. The value is rediculas!
So you provided false facts. Thank you very much for clearing that up
And that's still just as much as we have.
please drop to the lions
Troubled former @Lions WR Titus Young sentenced to four years in prison http:// ift.tt/2nynocK
Peppers isn't a first round pick. Would like him in the second round. The guy doesn't have position.
Oh no. Oh god no. Please no.
Actually what website have you been using? Hahaha lmao bc those are just false facts pic.twitter.com/D5fDJ411I8
Why
DO NOT DRAFT
I never said they were #1. But they've had 6 more than Detroit has had so maybe you should do some research
Saw it here first!
After 15 simulations, the best way for the @Lions to get impact players in at least 5 rds, they need to go defense in the first 2. #OnePride

That is impressive. I didn't know he blocked people at all.
He was really good. Just getting old
Could provide depth for cheap, I guess. FWIW, has been graded near the bottom by PFF every year since 2010.
haha, I don't know. Think I jokingly threw some shade at him for getting so many things wrong about the Lions last year.
How the hell do you get blocked by Ian Rapaport??
Saw only a few games, played pretty well. Not saying he's started material....Depth we want deptg
Oh. He's not very good.

@Lions seriously. You guys will make one of the biggest mistakes if @JabrillPeppers is on the board and you don't take him. Wake up!
@patcaputo98 why I love the book #nonameleftmispronounced As for mccaffrey why doesn't anyone bring up Toby Gerhart? @Lions need a RB
I think this is something Carolina could be interested in doing and paying 2 2nds for a super stud MLB seems like small price for Lions imo
Lions could package picks 21 and 53 and a 2018 2nd for picks 8 and 115 from Carolina. Value is even according to draft pick value chart.
According to NFL draft pick value chart, Carolina's 8th pick is worth 1400 points. But doesn't appear a player they covet will be available.
Rueben Foster is Patrick Willis 2.0 and the @Lions should do everything they can to get him. I think Carolina is the team to make deal with
I'm gonna unload my @Lions draft day wish. Middle LB is the biggest need by far and there just happens to be an elite MLB in this draft
How does this make sense
@lions for sure
@Lions need to take @SidneyJonesIV in round 2 if he's there... Please! Perfect fit with @_bigplayslay23 !! #OnePride
who do you have my @Lions taking ?? Any way it's peppers or cook?
Angus's Boyz shaping up nicely. #GoBRUINS #TrenchLife #LineOfMonstrosity
Best highlight from last season
The answer is he is work ethic more that any other in the SEC has a mean streak multiple moves for pass rushing
If the lions draft Barnett he will be all pro for a number of years - sack king for the #vols

Hanging a banner for playoff APPEARANCES, not even wins, is torture. @Lions

@VIVO_IPL @SRH Should be in hurry... so they can extra nett run rate points... Lets see how many overs did @LIONS Can give fight...
it might be his last spot b4 the cut
That's thing he lost some of the games through his terrible calls. The NY Giants game was a huge one
Geez Talent makes great coaches Brady-Belichick Favre-McCarty Montana-Walsh Bradshaw-Knowles Griese-Shula NEXT Stafford-Caldwell NOT FIRED
Hey, @Lions . Feel free to win the Super Bowl or something this season.
Still better than caldwell his 2nd season is his real coaching. Without SUH/Stafford he would be fired already
@Lions He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly. http:// verebuy.com
Stafford is a mystery. He has all the tools. But you never know what you're going to get from one season to the next.
Defensive coordinators are too good. If he can't stretch the field. They'll figure out how to stop him.
My concern is that he can't put the ball down field very well. That's a problem when you're down big or trailing with 2 minutes left.
I'm about 90% on Dak. Maybe not in the future, but today? Right now? Romo is the better QB by far.
That game was brutal! For both sides! It just worked out a little better for us.

QB in the playoffs. That's why I say look out the next year or two, I think Dallas will win one.
Won me over last season. I think Dallas is going win a super bowl in next year or two. History was not on Dak's side this year as a rookie
Game. That playoff loss to you guys two years ago was typical Lions. I have some hope now in that we have an actual GM, and Stafford finally
Of the NFC, well the Cowboys were, won 3 of the next 4 Super Bowls. We got rolled 41-10 in Washington following week in our only NFC title
Yep 1991 season, played on January 5, 1992. We rolled the Cowboys that day who were without Aikman. CBS was saying these two were the future

Discipline is one thing but you should react when the refs let the other team pick up and drop your qb after the whistle etc. and I mean etc
OMG, what's wrong with Jims face? I've never seen it do that before.

I completely agree. It just happens that I don't think Taco is the answer
Like it. Though I Don't see Reddick making it to 21 and I don't see Perine making it to 5th round.
Probably @TJLang70 because of the experience but both of these guys are SOLID picks for building a wall.
Our Linebacker core needs work but I hated not getting to the quarterback and allowing them so much time to throw hurt us badly last year
@UMichFootball DE Taco Charlton, had a visit with the @dallascowboys , is visiting the @Lions today. @MiamiDolphins soon too.
There is potential, but I think we could do better at that spot
It's the potential I'm looking at I see it it's there Ziggy Ansah was kind of thought of like that but Charlton got lots of QB pressures
Just didn't stand out enough ... I think he'll be a decent player, just not a great one
I don't think he'll be impact player in the pros. I watched every Mich game and he made some plays, but not often enough to be 1st rd imo
Lewis is a 2nd round pick, early 3rd at the latest. No way he's around in the 6th

@Lions we need to have back Anquan Boldin. Do what u need to do but Boldin is a player you can rely on to play physical and catch balls4sure
I'm pretty sure Lowell Lotulelei is staying for senior season
hope it falls that way
Like it a lot. Anytime you have Reddick in the first is a win in my book

@Lions please invest some time into trying to get Adrian Peterson on our roster. We really need a power back to pull the ground game.
@MikeOHaraNFL @ttwentyman I really hope that @AnquanBoldin will still with the @Lions for the 2017 season.
Very dumb
The g.o.a.t
Mel Kiper is an idiot, and the brass will no doubtedly select the wrong person.
It's suiting to know our best player ever was drafted the year I graduated high school!
Plz he probably hurt it doing one of his stupid off season stunts now trying to blame the @Lions
Lions stinks
Mel Kiper is by far the worst ever at making predictions. Check his record , I think he is in the negative..

@Lions We need a bruiser at RB to team with Riddick & Zenner. Bring in @AdrianPeterson especially with the additions of Lang & Wagner
Please God.. No Harris
With such a crap @CMU_Football schedule this year. I'm in for going gangbusters at 1 home @Lions game. Or like 1 and 1.
Or the one where you both flex after a @Lions victory!
Hell yeah man! Sounds like @Lions are reeeeeeal interested. I'll keep checking and def keep you posted on what I find out.

@Lions Dunham still got the ad off lol
Now he made big plays.....best corner the Lions ever seen
where can i read about this ?
Why?
He really showed that a smaller guy can be dominant! Flexibility, footwork and timing!
@Lions win a playoff game then you can say that.
@DetLionsRadio Can the @Lions afford to trade for Richard Sherman?
forgot what a spark he was
Those teams might of been awful but he was sooooo good man. One of my all time favs
Man he was great corner, unfortunately was on some bad teams

I didn't mean to jump on you bro. These boys need to step up from front to back. That's all I'm saying.
Every year teams draft after us and come up with better talent.
the decades. As long as we show to see one player they've never given us completeness.
I didn't criticize Barry. I criticize the Lion brain thrust over the year who have short changed us over
lol. Oh, I'm questioning you. You don't know your ass from an apple when it comes to football. That's why you're not a coach. ;)

. Coming down on losing! You can't see that? New England can win without a Barry. They divide that into
1 or 2 big runs but not the WIN!!! Where are the quality wins? I'm not coming down on Barry. I'm co
It's interesting you would criticize someone who's shows you aren't even fit to lace.
he was surrounded with? There is always one who doesn't get it. He goes to the game for the big tackle or

I'd give up Barry for 5 players from Alabama, Ohio State, Clemson ect.... Who understand team and winning!! Hard work!!
love Barry!
Quincy Wilson is the real deal, great size and speed. He should definitely be the pick
I you listen to Russell Wilson to Tom Brady, winning enthusiasm and attitude are what's needed. Not just one player!
Please Lions draft a big bruising running back !!
@Lions make good choices for the draft picks for next season
No the real is Walter Payton since he won a ring unlike the Lions who cant even win a playoff game
You see? Didn't mean a thing and didn't win a thing because as great as he was. He was infected by the losing disease

Though I am a @Lions fan, I'm in @Jaguars country. Hope they fix OL first @_fournette is great,but, give him at least a little bit of a hole

Wait why would you resign the best clutch receiver on the team last year? Get it done!
Take him back if he doesn't throw another bitch fit in a playoff game.
What does this mean? Is it code? Is he staying? Tell usssssss!!! #OnePride
The @Lions better. He was the only consistent receiver, until he had a meltdown in the playoff game. Still great hands still
Well duh he was one of the 2 guys consistently catching the passes thrown at him

I was born like 6 miles from the silverdome a day b4 @BarrySanders made his debut 4 the @Lions !! WYR? pic.twitter.com/QO4mVVjzcc
But yes INCOMPETENT WERE GONNA GO 3-13 next season because they are INCOMPETENT !
It was INJOKEU or whatever his name is
@DougAndGator971 I would go on a tirade rivaling the Mets guy who missed the game yesterday if the @Lions drafted a TE in the first round!
A veteran quarterback would be better
@Lions trade first round pick for @RSherman_25
Please tell me the @Lions are exploring options to pick up @RSherman_25 via trade. Him & @_bigplayslay23 would be absolutely filthy 2gether
Lmao
Incredibly clean footage of a 1939 NFL game has surfaced & it's fascinating http:// bit.ly/2nAqdIw @BrooklynDodgers @Lions #vintage #NFL

So happy we're getting 4 @Lions season tickets this year instead of 2
@AdrianPeterson is the player, the @Lions need to get, draft the rest! Offense line is here!QB is here!WRs & TE is here

@Lions can y'all try and get Richard Sherman pls
Very old Conyers lacks the energy to fight for this or any other cause. Michigan needs new blood in Congress to fight for you.

Aye @lions trade wateva nd get Sherman please

Majority of @Lions fans support legalizing, regulating #sportsbetting http:// cbsloc.al/2oICQj4 https:// twitter.com/CBSDetroit/sta tus/849632824932151297 …
Some members of the local media ( @marcfell from @DrewMikePodcast ) are claiming it was poor tackling by the officer.
@Lions Lets give the girls something to cheer about! Not just a play or two but a whole season of wining football!!
If you'd like to troll any past Miami Hurricanes classes that fell apart please CC @Lions That's where he works now..
I know! I know!! (It takes a team, o-line and defense) But you start with a leader who overcome. Not just a sore finger. Overcome!!!
Deshaun folks! If he is available. We need a winning attitude at quarterback. Someone who has won something and can win big games!
They need to come to Wembley again! Need to get myself to ford field too

@ttwentyman can we trade our 1st and 2nd for Todd Gurley?! @Lions @RamsNFL @AdamSchefter
One day I will make the same trip. From Yorkshire myself.
Good. Now trade 1st and 2nd picks for Todd Gurley!! @Lions @RamsNFL https:// twitter.com/ttwentyman/sta tus/849582933426008066 …
Get a front line an secondary
I'm a @Lions fan and I'm telling you... do NOT draft "Mitchell" Trubisky. DO. NOT!
Haha
#OnePride
Yes, because we all know Rudock's first throw will be an interception.
that's awesome. I made it my first time 2 years ago and took the tour. It was amazing!
THE DAILY DRIVE: #Lions want a 3rd quarterback; will they draft one? http:// bit.ly/2o9IsFk pic.twitter.com/jZRn4dboIA
So good to hear Bob, my HS classmate's voice for the first time in over twenty years. Was smiling ear to ear with pride.
Was great to see ! Next time for a game ! Only seen the lions at @wembleystadium before! Detroit was amazing #onepride
0-16 next season @Lions https:// twitter.com/mailonline/sta tus/720582644942155777 …
Thanks for visiting @fordfield ! pic.twitter.com/liAUN1VJVg
Finally made it to Ford field for the first time last weekend! @lions fan from Edinburgh, Scotland ! #onepride #detroit #lions @NFLUK pic.twitter.com/QmWP8o4EHz
What can I say, I'm passionate about my team

Why? So they can cut them like they did to Rudock? The brass at Ford Field aren't very bright. Caldwell will never bring a SB to Detroit.
Broke my @surface & just days after putting on a @Lions cover on it. Hopefully this isn't a sign a precursor for this year's season #SoSad pic.twitter.com/1SMxW6Pjjr
The @Lions are expecting big things from former @AlabamaFTBL standout @AshawnRobinson . http://www. al.com/sports/index.s sf/2017/04/ashawn_robinson_kept_getting_b.html …
Always knew the lions were gay
Damn the new Lion King really made Simba gay huh?
Explain yourself @Lions https:// twitter.com/mailonline/sta tus/720582644942155777 …
@Lions @ttwentyman
You'd look incredible in @Lions gear. #justsayin
Or even @RashadJennings would be a good fit
Hey @Lions you want a banger at RB? Go sign @LG_Blount NOW
I'd agree, unless the Lions think he can run, catch, special teams, and play defense. ie- no chance the lions take him at 21
Jamen, jeg holder med @Lions ;-)
https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=tad3NI 68dKA&sns=tw … via @youtube @ttwentyman tell Quinn sign @AdrianPeterson before it's to late. ADRIAN!! @Lions @ShepMatt
