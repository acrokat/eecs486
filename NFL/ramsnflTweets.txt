Based on what he played good for a quarter against number 3s in preseason relax
thank you for pointing this out. He has some of the blame too.
No Freakin' Kidding
Battle for LA baby! This is what it's all about! What a great rivalry that goes back 4 months! #boltup #fistforla #housethatdeanleased
I know what I said and yes the main reason for them moving is because their fans are trash
This guys an idiot. I think 30k at coliseum is why rams left in 94. Then they stopped showing after 4 losing games. Try 12 years
@RamsNFL did you not see this? I'm #NotRenewing you fucked up, stop sending me emails #Rams #LARams #nfl #espn @Sean_McVay @Stanley_Kroenke https:// twitter.com/louisdelacosta /status/849674865279774720 …
shut up. He never played for LA.
#NotYourCaptain
There is no more St. Louis Rams fans since that isnt a team
@JLaurinaitis55 here's to you and a great career. May your retirement be filled with joy and music @RamsNFL @Saints @NFL @BuckeyeFootbalI pic.twitter.com/AR4qkfeVyM
Too bad team ownership wasn't dedicated to winning like he was.
Congrats to one of my all time favorite Rams, James Laurinaitis! Even though you never played in LA, you're still loved by ALL LA Rams fans
St Louis Rams fans > LA Rams fans dont @me
Mo Alie-Cox to the @RamsNFL would make my entire life. #RamNationOrNoNation
Van a ganar mis @RamsNFL pic.twitter.com/WvmXw2vU9y
Really was hurting you with yo @10thstnardy
Nobody even wanted the chargers in LA lol
No he'll forever be a St. Louis Ram captain
Congrats @JLaurinaitis55
Riiiiight...that's why.
Biased* and no it isn't
To the beach maybe...not to wins...
They did not move because of attendance. JFC! And it does say Los Angeles. Right there in the name.
Dante. Donde puedo conseguir el calendario si es q ya esta disponible?
@RamsNFL I knew Jared god was the worst option for you guys. He has no guts to play. At least I have that he doesn't have it.
Crazy how starters play a lot week 3. #battleforLA
Great Guy!!! Great Player!!! Thanks for the Memories!!!
letzzz gozzz..
No, obviously you didn't lose your team. Please don't associate LA with St Louis. Enos screwed St Louis royally (along w/Jerry Jones) thanks
@JLaurinaitis55 , you set the standard for what we hope for in our @RamsNFL players.Thx for the memories you created & the lives you impacted pic.twitter.com/9hw2wxzSIE
He was NEVER your Captain. He was St Louis rams captain...
I feel for the Rams, the Chargers will dominate 2017 in LA. Mark my words and feel free to contact me later to say that I was wrong.
Thank you @JLaurinaitis55 for everything you have done for the @RamsNFL organization! Forever a Ram! #MobSquad
That's the reason they moved, because they had no fans and/or the sucked. You're obviously bias.
You should let your play do the talking since you have not won a game as a starting QB.
@RICHELLERYAN @TheCousinSal The @RamsNFL hc is 31 years old, the qb couldnt call plays last training camp- over under win 3 games?I say 2-14
You the man @kurt13warner @RamsNFL https:// twitter.com/nfluk/status/8 51905259006021633 …
He never played in LA. Stop
Big Shoutout @RamsNFL
Stan does.
He is a St. Louis Ram for life.
Man fuck all this st louis/los angeles bullshit, a Ram is a Ram, a real fan doeant care which city he played for! @RamsNFL
It says nothing about LA Rams, jfc your team moved because their fans suck get over it
He'll be the captain of the saint louis rams forever.
But it's the Cardinals!!!
Fortunately he never played in LA...forever a St Louis #Captain
3rd game is where starters usually play more. Chargers just happened to be the 3rd team. Dallas is cool just because it's 1st game
****ST LOUIS RAMS
@JLaurinaitis55 #ThankYouCaptain @RamsNFL
Very underrated player loved watching him play for the rams
It was a pleasure to work with you in '14 when I was with the @RamsNFL . You're a great person James. Wish you and your family all the best

his receivers would drop EVERYTHING. Good, catchable balls dropped
Don't let my comment offend you. It's just joke bud
Sure.......
you're right, passes hitting the receivers right in there hands, such an uncatchable ball

@RamsNFL are you playing the @RAIDERS at home this season?
Get Spruce Healthy. Hes definitely needed.
we love Aaron Donald- Penn Hills Oa
But Rams have one of the worst VPs to run a team (5 win a year avg) so there is that. pic.twitter.com/5vfQGDPhcC
Did you know that due to the vastness of the universe, we are all very close to each other AND very far away, depending on your viewpoint.
Goff looks to have put on some bulk. Hope so.
Do you agree with @JaredGoff16 ? How close are the Rams?
well i guess you're done then
ya dude, jigsaw puzzles are hard.
Hopefully with (2nd most losing coach ever) Jeff Fischer out of the picture, the RAMS will have a better season and win a game with Goff.
So goff is getting excited about losing his virginity. Get it in there @JaredGoff16 just stick it in pal. You got this
I wanna see the fucking playoffs this year or we done @RamsNFL https:// twitter.com/ramsnfl/status /851877837388734464 …
Maybe in 2017 his passes will be a lot closer to his intended receivers.
Let's go ramssssss
A lot closer » http:// gora.ms/EajbLj pic.twitter.com/OkKjKRfjs4
Maybe if he had some offensive protection he could run the ball!
@RamsNFL is vey good last publid in wall
You da boss man!
We will definitely get to the t-shirts today...
By '& more...' I'm sure you mean the @RamsNFL new t-shirts, right? #championship #McKid
Love this! get it!
Mention it to Rams to make these shirts available for fans to buy.
For sure
@ColinCowherd says the Rams are unwatchable but @_LARamsNation @RamsNFL he will jump on the bandwagon....it's his nature! Go figure!

which is one step closer to real football
I double checked this and it was fabricated. I showed this to the NFL and they will promptly be removing 1st and 2nd round drafts from Rams.
I can't believe it. This might be a pre-season game with real importance.

I honestly get pure enjoyment out of it. I can't help it. Let me live my life!
I went with 7 key ones, not sure all of the signings stick on the 53 man roster
But yeah. I was just adding the whole #because i am impressed with wha they did with the amount of cap space they had
Travis Wilson, Dunbar, Walker, NRC, Murray, the DE/OLB, Long Snapper ...
*Not including their own
@RamsNFL https:// twitter.com/bleacherreport /status/851809942977859584 …
Yes he is lmfao
I'm more excited about Barwin and Whitworth. Barwin is a perfect fit for Wade and brings leadership. Same with Whit
It's preseason....
They actually signed 14 FA's but yeah :)
Yes!!! This is what I've been saying, I'm just happy that it looks like we are trying!
Be real - if predicted in Feb. that @RamsNFL sign 7 FA's including Whitworth, Woods, Webster & Barwin + keep Tru, you'd have been thrilled
He is just bored by the lack of meaningful questions by LA media.

Best wishes for a GREAT season. Can't wait to watch. #WeNotMe

You're lucky for that sir
But we can use that excuse for every QB on a bad team.

I'm glad they are coming to Cleveland. 2 hour drive instead of a 12
The @NFL & Roger Goodell missing the boat, the @Raiders vs @RamsNFL pre-season game should be played in #LasVegas ! @RalstonReports
He's a good quarterback. Had very little around him. Gurley had no holes to run through
Let's get it @AaronDonald97 #MobSquad 2.0
Are you guys back practicing at CLU?
Maybe hit Gurley with some smelling salts before he steps in front of a mic. Dude always seems like he's half asleep.

How was Cleveland able to keep the Browns name?

The adoption happened
But will the Cards watch film and fix it?
This is when @pinksurvivor70 and I first met you !
Only the give props to the real SAN DIEGO #Charger fans, no these fake paid actors.....

It really doesn't matter where chargers play. They do not have a large fan base period.
You're a #Dolts sympathizer, what do you know about the rich tradition of LA #Rams football?!
Not a fight at all when nobody in LA even gives 2 's about #Dolts or there fight for Attention.....
Just embarrassing how they market. They'd be smart to quit pretending it's a #FightForLa . It's so disingenuous. It's really a #Fightfor $.

It seems that aside from Carp, Fowler, Molina, & Pisciotti, Cards lineup comprised of platoon players. Cecil looks horrid.
Go RAMS!
Chargers vs Rams will be a lot of fun. Can't wait for this rivalry to take off.
Did the @Cardinals stay in Florida?
71-91 might be a stretch
6 points? Someone's being generous
Very bad vibe, this could be a 100 loss team. No stars, big talent gap vs other teams.
LOL
Close game......OH this was a baseball game...
Well, we have the MLB version
The Nats gift-wrapped this game to the cards and they still get blown out
Does that mean we're going 71-91 this year ?!?
A 14-6 loss. It's as if we had the @CoachJeffFisher @RamsNFL again!

That's wonderful.
I hope we get some other running backs just in case he performs like he did last year. I was not impressed with his effort.
Happy Birthday!! Enjoy your day!! #BillsFamForLife
Yeah... Both suck
gooder*
ATL Falcons are the biggest chokers I have ever seen. Tampa Bay will win your division
You think devin Hester will make them good?
@CrimsonChin821 they got the super bowl in the preseason
What did the Chargers do in the offseason besides cut players? Look what the Rams did. Rams are a better team than your slapdick 3-13 team.
It's nothing else new I need lol that's all you need to know my guy that's going stick with the your team until they win a Super bowl
Cool?
#KroenkeOut @RamsNFL @ColoradoRapids @nuggets

Did Sean McVay have the old Jeff Fisher parking spot painted to look like a field? I never cared for the Margaritaville look, but that’s me.
Added!
I count 7 players with solid NFL experience on this roster. Something the previous administration refused to do.
Kroenke has officially turned @Arsenal to the @RamsNFL , a crap team whose sole purpose is to make money #kroenkeout
When are they available on http:// therams.com ? Let me know, thanks!
Will those shirts be for sale soon I hope?
@RSherman_25 In my opinion is @RamsNFL should be as a huge winner and Los Angeles is your home where you are from. Please think about it.
We need an 88 like the Cowboys have...
@RSherman_25 Rich, There's one of the NFL Teams that's closer to your home of Compton, CA are #1 @RamsNFL or #2 @chargers
Love @RamsNFL hc. High energy and he knows what he's talking about
Thanks for the roster. Been wondering about a few guys positions/jersey numbers.
It would be great if we could purchase the "We Not Me" shirts! @RamsNFL

@MMAIndiaShow Looks like @Anthony_Rumble moving to @NFL @RamsNFL ... @KayfabeDiaries
Hey @RamsNFL can ye weigh in on the heavy Anthony Johnson rumours?
Looks like @Anthony_Rumble profile says he's going to the @RamsNFL pic.twitter.com/7W58YeFu16
Anthony 'Rumble' Johnson says his next venture after MMA has nothing to do w/ @RamsNFL . So we're to believe he's just a superfan? #UFC210
Johnson denies the report of him being apart of @RamsNFL . #UFC210
Much respect on all you do @Anthony_Rumble but why the hell the @RamsNFL #thankyourumble but thats a #badfranchise

So my favorite fighter @Anthony_Rumble retires... AND I just figured out he is also a @RamsNFL fan. Man this is depressing. Thank you Rumble
He's likely going to work with the @RamsNFL on their coaching staff. It's in his bio and rumor is he was wearing their gear all week.

Serious kudos to @KatCressida for her loyalty to @HoustonTexans . In the last 2 years, she's surrounded by @RamsNFL and @LAChargers_AFC .

Lol you got to do some research brotha. Rams D is good. Top 10! Russ D is better but not by much. We must not watch the same games lol
NOT sure the @RamsNFL fan REALLY knows about D. And we ARE comparing James & Russ.
@AUS10SPORTS @SLOTGOD21 not sure he wanted to come back to play for the rams he had too

I agree. Such an amazing feeling having coaching staff that is aware of the teams needs and also not stuck in 1999 football schemes.

Yeah but what are his ratings against GOOD qbs and not phins backup and jets? Because I never heard of the kid and watched just about all
Nice pickup but they're still trash
this is pretty lit
Also a pick6 on the rams coincidentally
it's because nickel CBs aren't popular
A very solid signing for this secondary. Remember who the DC is.
My bills losing and losing players, another long season for my furb cows
They have all been quality signings. It is refreshing watching this new coaching staff work. #culture #InMcVayWeTrust
did the rams change their jerseys?
Nickell isn't bad
I think he's a cornerback
I hope so We need a championship in LA I am so happy the Rams have moved back home
Second lowest passer rating allowed out of all slot CB's last year and people are asking who he is. Go figure. Nice signing.
he was rated the 2nd best Nickel CB in the NFL last year by PFF he had a 77 QBR when throwing at him
#WHO ??
Polk County
Can't get a quarterback for a nickel.
