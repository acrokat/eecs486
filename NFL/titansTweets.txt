@Titans how many retweets do I need for a signed Marcus Mariota jersey
I'm already a proud PSL holder
Mike Keith is the most under-utilized personality the team has. Incredibly easy to like, smart, has great insight, & great play by play
Seriously, @titansradio has team access no one else has. Would think the @Titans would want fan engagement with a reguler stream of radio..?
Man I love hanging out with friends! @TShawsTruth @Titans #Nashville pic.twitter.com/moCHi03UDg
I just counting on this draft to be as deep as they say it is. But I agree with you
Agree with you 100% ^^^ the good perk was having the access to the club level area(s) that only season ticket holders had.
We'd like to welcome @J_Cunningham89 of the @Titans to the #PGSportsTeam ! https:// cards.twitter.com/cards/7s1v3o/4 0xdq …
I would only like that if certain players are off the board, especially at 18. Some players are worth drafting than receiving a 2nd

Well you're PSL member probably because you want to go to games. idk maybe I'm wrong. I know that's why I am.
If he can trade back on both first round picks and get 2 additional second round picks as well..
Good luck! But for real, this is the year of the @Titans !!

Titans need to keep the Jake Locker pick. Cost us a few years but we ended up with a great one in Mariota.

Looks good i am ready for football #TitanUp
I can't help but notice @Titans are on there #KeepPounding
Yeah Corey Davis or Mike Williams at 5, then go CB at 18. Garson Conley from Ohio State maybe. Or Tabor/Wilson from Florida
I'd like the @Titans to take a WR in our first pick. Been a while since we had a real play maker at that position.
I didn't like the fact that he would be walking away for another team. But handing him over to the Patriots would be criminal.

Wow not again. Why is it open to the public? It should be a perk for being a PSL owner! Why be a season ticket holder if anyone can come!
Maybe. But I'll give him a chance, just like everyone else draft

Howard at 5 is the dark horse I'm betting on.
That's not my point. You could take his speed away and he'd still be a top 5 receiver in the draft

I'm down

Lol!
why is there like 4 days for some games?

So why in the hell would you want to settle for him?
I'm just saying he might be our only option, which is a pretty dang good last resort if you ask me
Where did I ever say that he's better than them. Of course he's not! I would take Williams or Davis by a mile over this kid
Yea a whole 30 yards against Alabama! If you actually believe Ross is better than Williams or Davis you should watch some football
Why not trade #5 for #12 plus Josh Gordon? @Titans @3HL1045
Yes
Running routes really well
Are you even a Titans fan? Cause you have no idea what you're talking about. He's small, but he has thing called being really fast and...
Yes I saw that. I didn't look it up as I'm traveling. They should have used the airplane icon LOL
Is there any thought to STH's in the scheduling. Prices raised and then STHs forced to pay to see starters play 2 series entire preseason
I like always playing them last game. It's like playing a Div II team to boost confidence
Ok thank you
Anyone having the @Titans taking john ross is ridiculous. They don't need another small ass slot WR https:// twitter.com/jwyattsports/s tatus/851550394786471936 …

According to the NFL, that Titans/Bears game on 8/27 will be a noon kick
The @Titans preseason schedule: WK 1 at NY Jets, WK 2 host Carolina Panthers, WK 3 host Chicago Bears & on the road at KC Chiefs in WK 4.
I don't think you draft a cb at 5. Allen or Adams would be great pickups. Maybe Howard or wr at 18. Maybe trade down at 5 to get a 1st + 2nd
Actually I just really hope we don't play the @Titans in October because if we do I'm going to cry

Rishard Matthews (13th Air Yds, 6th Total TD's) would be an intriguing value if he ends up being the #1 WR for the @Titans offense in 2017.
Yeah very concerned PSL owner!!!!! Also: will the walking vendors take cards? Time for the titans to step up with today's technology!!
Lol... I threw up a little in my mouth! Stop pilfering from the PNW lol!
@Titans , you guys really need to get Richard Sherman !
I hope he stays in Seattle so they crumble
Ross is a talented receiver; great burner, sure hands, and smooth route runner, but he's not what the @Titans are looking for.
Absolutely, but you have to admit, he would thrive in Nashville. pic.twitter.com/FHXjp5qVf4
Tennessee tackles are nasty. They don't have no Osemele though
@Titans
Yeah I said they didn't have enough for the player and a 1st asking price. Do they have the player?
You literally said they didn't have enough. You're players hate ur team so much it's funny. First lynch retires early now rich wants out lol
Then why bring it up? They don't have the players to be in contention anyway. 2 first rounders wasn't in play by anyone but you
@Titans John Ross just said wants to play for Marcus
Tennessee would never give up that for a corner past his prime with their team as young and promising as it is lmfao

Thank you @Titans for getting rid of @Aramark @aramarksportTN and their horrible concessions that aren't fit for death row inmates.
Do the titans have enough to trade though? Likely take a good player and a 1st...

Los @Titans es un equipo q está haciendo bien las cosas. Firmó a Logan Ryan en FA y tiene 2 CBs q no van mal, pero Sherman le daría ese plus
No. Just no. Titans need to get a young shutdown CB and skip the "been there, done that" sentimentality. Don't waste valuable picks, pls.
NOT! He ain't going nowhere!!
Why put him in toilet paper???
Nah look better in a pats jersey

Lol.. tds... b.c of your passing offense. I can remember a game where they had 3 1 yd rushing tds. Even if they didn't, that's dumb.
Must be nice to be able to stop behind the line of scrimmage and not get destroyed by the DL. Not possible on most teams
hell no this can't be serious... the dude makes holes for himself with his patience and shiftiness
Good draft, but I'm out on lattimore, injury prone!
Imagine the @Titans after this draft #TitanUp pic.twitter.com/q9QGPpl05Q
It depends on what formation and what player you're talking about. On many plays a corner is playing man even though there is a blitz/zone
Titans played the 2nd most man of any team in the NFL last year. I think LeBeau has adjusted again
Sherman understands the zone coverage concept more than many, Lebeau loves zone. These are his stats at 6"3 194 pounds. @Titans Do it. pic.twitter.com/EGKFCTjNfW
Should @Titans consider trading for Sherman or stick to the best option in the draft ? In Robinson I trust @jwyattsports #titans #nfl

@NFL wtf. Stats don't lie. By far, the Saints and the Steelers offensive line had a better year that the Cowboys and Titans o-line. #wtf
To*
Well true..we run a glorified west coast offense most route combinations are underneath..he has too
Partially Bc brees' release time is incredible. Hard to get that man down
offensive. And just stating what I believe. Biased maybe, but I'm high on our OL.
if the saints don't, Falcons definitely don't. That's what I'm sayin.

But if SF takes a QB at 2, I could see there being a run with the Jets and possibly Bills taking one before it even gets back to Cle at 12
I honestly don't think they should trade up at all. The whole class is too deep to give up picks this year.
And I am not even a Ten. fan lol
It makes sense! The DB class is deep. Could easily upgrade on D in the 2nd. Adding 2 WR/TE in the 1st would make them the best young Off.
Tf are you talking about? The saints don't have a top 5 o line lmao everyone knows it. Who are you gonna take out of this top 5 list for the
A year removed from being ranked 2nd in run blocking & our top LT wasn't healthy all season...you just read articles dude you dk football
You gotta talk about run blocking too, saints don't have a top 5 o line. It's underrated but not top 5, you're just being biased
Oh shut up only two teams on the list allowed less sacks than us... ya allowed 10 more than us

Where tf' is Packers?
Saints o line is not better than any of those o lines on the list. So no its not top 5

It's definitely not top 5 though
Can't imagine Larry Allen without a full cage
we both know that's a damn lie
Cowboys:6027 total yards, 49 total TD's, sacks allowed 36 Titans:5728, 46TD's, sacks allowed 28 Raiders:5973, 47TD's, sacks allowed 18 Oak>
@WatchJRoss knows what's up in TN with the @Titans pic.twitter.com/NkGhd0gH9m
nah, 1. dallas, 2. packers, 3. raiders, 4. titans, 5 browns
I don't understand how Sam Bradford didn't die last season. There was a reason he only threw dunk and dunk passes. Never had time.
TJ Clemmings was rated by @PFF as the 3rd worst Left Tackle they've ever rated.
at least you guys don't have a player that hasn't played football since middle school starting on your offensive line
No I don't watch the Vikings. All I got to say is Russell Okung
No reason to have it
Having a big bar going down the middle is a little detrimental to vision
Ain't got time to check;as it says in my profile I don't go all in on NFL until the MLB postseason's over.I know my Raiders OL is in there.
I don't know if you watch the Vikings this season, but all I have to say is TJ Clemmings
@WatchJRoss I hope @Titans draft you bruh we'd love to have you & you and mariGOATa will be force for years to come ... TITAN UP BABY!!
Btw OAK 'non dominant' run O had more TDs than TEN rushing... ho hum.
Not too different. I'm just sayin' No one wears the full one anymore. Last gut was I think, Jeff Saturday
Broncos is 39th then

Lol Well if you say so. Take away the running QB stats and OAK run O dominated Ten run O and pass O isn't even comparable. OAK by miles
Vikings is 38th then.
I was referring to the tweeted picture but okay

These are full caged face masks? pic.twitter.com/fJkoLCkxlB
go to bed
As evidenced by Oakland's unstoppable run game. Tennessee oline with 2 backup guards was tons better than Oakland. Pundits & analytics agree
@RAIDERS saved you a click
There's really not, just traffic cones lol
The sarcasm in my reply was accurate.
Really cause his career TD-Int ratio is 2.12. QB's ahead of him? Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, Aaron Rogers, Russell Wilson
That Dallas OLine can guide Trump throu downtown Detroit
Those are full caged masks actually they're designed for lineman
What looks stupid is having a 320 lb lineman wearing a face mask of a skilled positioned player
I didn't even know there was an OL in Minnesota or Seattle , not a single player could be even top 5 behind their current lines
I don't think anyone has ever said this
good thing Romo retired. all the missiles he'd launch would be intercepted
Everyone realized they looked stupid as technology advanced
Yes but he wouldn't be nearly as good behind an OL like Minnesota or Seattle. If he couldn't be patient, he wouldn't be top 3
Who needs condoms when u can use the Cowboys oline, which gives u a higher protection percentage
Hope this is a troll
But that along with a Top 5 scoring def didn't help Dak at all. That 13-3 record was literally ALL Dak. Lmao.
Cowboys by a lot... but OAK OL >>>>> TEN. It's not even close honestly.
No Redskins gtfoh
What happened to the full cage face masks linemen used to wear? pic.twitter.com/PMfrLLQPpJ

"very good player" is definitely vague. Sherman can handle Nuk, A-rob, & Hilton. He brings attitude & perspective of a super bowl champion..
I'd like to get on the list for those tickets please!
no, they want a "very good player" plus a high pick. we dont need to give the farm for an aging corner with a fascination for talking ****

He should only value their input if they're telling him to take either Malik Hooker, Jamal Adams, Jonathan Allen, or OJ Howard at #5!
What's the asking price for Richard Sherman?....... @Titans we need a corner(s)
@jwyattsports @Titans @RSherman_25 @NFL tell Sherman we run the ball at the 1 yard line
How the hell is @J_7TRE_E not with the @Titans ?? I mean he's got plenty of tread on the tires and we need a decent Guard #TitanUp

yep.. Plus he's a zone CB & LeBeau loves that zone defense
It also allows the team to work on younger CBs to maybe find a future starter after Sherman leaves.
@Titans sounds good to me.. Get a top 5 CB and get another pick we can add a FS or CB or get a WR

love the Lattimore pick (Adams also a good grab), still high on Howard at receiving TE, though Davis has some great size also
Thoughts @PaulKuharskyNFL @withrowzone @Hutton1045 @bbishop23 @MickeyRyan1045 ?
Might get yal TE outta Bama at 18
We talkin championship in Tennessee and over here in carrick
@Titans stop playing and get Richard Sherman
Yes pro bowl last year.. what if your @Titans got @RSherman_25 @3HL1045 @brentdougherty would be a huge loss for my #hawks
I don't think u get me fam I would think getting Sherman is a good move but u said throw the house at him
Not with that contract. Plus Sherman is highly overrated. Hold all the time and doesn't follow the #1 around. Nah
We're going to end up drafting a tight end and OL in the first round when we need a corner, safety, WR and DL so id rather have sherman tbh
This is a fire draft for y'all to have these picks in
But you can use them to draft corners if u want another one or weapons you don't need two lock down corners especially in that division
I'll be sick if we don't
Hey @Titans how about some Richard Sherman?
Yea we have plenty of picks that we'll use on something we don't need
National analysts are ignorant....we have @J_Cyprien @DSearcy_21 AND @KB31_Era we aren't drafting ANOTHER Safety in the 1st round
But you're not just signing him like a FA you have to trade something for him
Uh because our defense is ass, we have the money and he's still one of the best in the league
1 why 2 define the house for a old corner
Yes throw it all
@Titans ... let's uh... take a nice long look here.
if davis falls to us at 18 this could shape out to be a really good year
Wow Mel, you're only 4 months too late on that observation #SMH
@Titans https:// twitter.com/ProFootballTal k/status/849715968666460162 …

I doubt that
. @MelKiperESPN previously had @WatchJRoss going 18th to @Titans . Now has him sliding to 32. “It is more the injury thing ... and the size."
If Lattimore is there, we need an elite DB, take him. If he's gone, then yeah trade back ASAP.
You'll never understand
it wasn't a good look for the @Titans , either
old news
Sweet
. @MelKiperESPN said on CC "there's been talk that Tennessee could be looking to trade out of 5 and move down." @Titans
@Titans Mike Williams at #5, then go get a DB at #18. This draft has amazing depth on defense.
Just asked @MelKiperESPN on CC about the @Titans , and options in the first round. Banging out story now.

Man I know. I wish we would tho he'd be good. I'd feel better with our secondary with him on the team
Aye @Titans why not go after @RSherman_25 if he's actually up for trade ??
Please please please draft him if he's available at #5 @Titans #TITANUP https:// twitter.com/ESPNNFL/status /849689720019968000 …

The @Titans need to put a bid in for Sherman
Send him to @Titans please https:// twitter.com/nfl/status/849 683167057522691 …

@Titans cough cough https:// twitter.com/nfl/status/849 683167057522691 …
I have a feeling JRob will trade down from 5 tho, and possibly quite a bit. I'd bet he'd go to mid round or later for a couple extra picks
the @Titans could use him https:// twitter.com/espn/status/84 9675537081675780 …

Hey this looks familiar! Haha!
Not ideal, but I'd give Cyp the nod over current group of LBs. Would love an ILB upgrade, but not sure happens on day1. Foster would B gr8.
@RSherman_25 to the @Titans or @Jaguars makes the most sense
Let's get @RSherman_25 to Nashville @Titans
I would disagree. Cyp is a box guy, doesn't cover well, and @Titans have a long history of getting destroyed by TEs. Foster would be great
@Titans https:// twitter.com/allanbell247/s tatus/849663859623383040 …
@Titans let's trade for Sherman
@Titans DRAFT THIS MAN https:// twitter.com/badam_tdr/stat us/849639210286022656 …
as a multicultural person, it's almost racist not to draft me, PR nightmare imho
Gotta look at chaws put in per quarter. People forget that.
@Titans trade a 3rd round for Sherman. It would hella be an upgrade
redefine our own pro day events. Ex: Play naming Crowd hype Sweatband count Gatorade sharing
Extra spin zone: maybe we grade out higher than 5.4 bc of our pecs. We should declare.
@Zack_Hillis82 @VelKrowe @lebronbron14 @Titans I grade out at 6.9 as a distant cousin of the Gronkowski family
Jamal Adams career TD = 0 Eddie Jackson = 5
not his fault he broke his leg and didn't play the second half of the season
Josh Harvey-Clemmons, who doesn't even speak fluent English, graded out higher. #hmmmmmm
#hmm pic.twitter.com/Gy1LXtyoBI
American football and probably shooty hoops
Fencing
At what sport?
Eddie jackson is better
If Adams is available at 5 and if @Titans pass on him I'll be really disappointed
@Titans @JerryDios get on it!
We HAVE to take him if he's still there at 5. He's Earl Thomas/EB good.

@Titans please draft @TheAdams_era at 5 this man is going to be a superstar.
I'm thinking trade back too but we need a cb in the first round if we don't get a second round pick back
If Solomon Thomas or Jamal Adams aint there, either trade back to 10-12 or take Corey Davis
Ready for draft see who we are gonna get in 1st round @Titans #injohnwetrust #maketitansgreatagain#TITANUP

Of course...I said rarely. Any AFC North matchup NOT featuring the @Browns is worth dressing up for. @Titans vs @Jaguars - not so much.

Aye @Titans don't draft a CB at #5, trust me on this.
Would love to see you in @Titans blue @EJackson_4 gonna be a steal
what do you want most in a WR? Speed,size, or hands?
I am so ready for football season @Titans #TitanUp
welcome to Tennessee big homie let's get to them playoffs
and get Marshon Lattimore at 5
Corey Davis
@Trey_Zero Congrats on signing with @Titans !!! Imma need another autograph! #BoomSoon #Hero #KeepGrindin pic.twitter.com/bNVu8CYPsS

What question would you ask @Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota? http:// dlvr.it/Np0XMF

Prediction: @Titans trade out of #5 to early teens, get 2nd RD pick, draft @WatchJRoss then at #18 draft @David_Njoku80 @CFD22 @MikeMayock

I see all these lazy mock drafts of the @Titans choosing Adams or Hooker at 5 & I'm like WTF? we have @KB31_Era @J_Cyprien & @DSearcy_21
I hope so. I think they can still get a player they like if they move down a few spots.
Yeah but he'll be good if he stays healthy, did well in Buffalo last year
Zierlins mock is terrible no way we go Guard at 18.
Oh I wasn't talking Howard, he's a beast. I was hearing the TE from Miami that I can't spell
I hear ya, but oj howard is no slouch either
i like him too
Yep! And when I look at the things JROB looks for: tough, team first, dependable, productive...I am constantly brought back to Corey Davis.
I just feel we need to get the best prospects possible at the positions we need in R1 before we fill backups. Mainly defense
among the possibilities
sadly?
injury history def something to consider
I tried to fill every need that needed to be filled. If you have any questions or suggestions comment below.
. @Titans ditch the 2 tone jerseys and bring it back to a better time. Go back to your roots with Classic Oilers colors! #Titans pic.twitter.com/PA7YAIuZ4j
A lot of predictions for Ross at 18. There's NO way JROB does that with his injury history. We want "tough, dependable players".
Keep the picks. Defense and then offense with the 2 picks,. I can see it going many ways. S? CB? LB? WR? TE? Hmmm
any word on training camp dates?
Congrats to the #soloeastnashville owner, @titans own @tokssokoya ! Excited for you to have your… https://www. instagram.com/p/BSb5cLNBDFW/

Okay gotcha I'm a Justin fan too, sucks he's on the Steelers now
@Titans https:// twitter.com/bleacherreport /status/848981697496469504 …
Would love to see @Titans pick up S Malik Hooker at #5 and WR Jon Ross at #18. They will bring strong competition to both sides of the ball!
I like it. Adding some size, attitude, and toughness to the competition is great. J-Rob is $.
You're as strong as your weakest link. He's a special teams body. If he replaces the worst CB from last yr and is better, they got better.
yeah but I stay loyal to my man Justin, even though im a Titans fan first
@RoachSoReal
still have to get Marshon Lattimore and Corey Davis
Boomer
Bro you know Justin ain't even on the Titans right
