If @HoustonTexans take kizer at 25, we get mahomes, I mean the Texans DID almost give 72 mil to osweiler so anythings possible
None. That's why I do not count my Monopoly money as income. Just stay healthy.

None until we figure out the QB situation
@HoustonTexans If you sign #Kaepernick , You Will cause a Revolt We the FANS Do Not Want Him We will #Boycott
@HoustonTexans will wish he fell if he's taken higher, and be worried why he didn't get picked if he falls to #25.
None count , but you still want your backups to win em' all... Including week 4 so we won't hear loudmouths for at least another week.
Would be cool for @NRGParkFan to denote where the first MLB pitch was thrown on Texas soil.

Adorable!
Patriots - would be Cowboys, except that's preseason game 4, when only scrubs are playing.
the one that starts the quickest!
" @HoustonTexans : #Texans fans, which preseason game are you most looking forward to?" New England at home
How can't the 4th preseason game be voted most? The starters don't even play. Week 3 preseason is the best preseason game always.
i was the first
@HoustonTexans https:// twitter.com/complexsports/ status/851900134493442048 …
None without Romo.
Kicking Dallas' ass for sure

@HoustonTexans please draft this guy @PatrickMahomes5
See if Dameris will donate all Hoffy burger profits to help
Yes, we might be able to draft him 2nd. rd. We need to get Kap. Turbisky 1st. rd., Mahomes 2nd. 5 QB total to battle it out.
This ones not even a graduation though. College fairs could be hosted at so many other places than @NRGParkFan SMH.
I totally agree and the @HoustonTexans should draft him in the 1st round. Do you think 1st round is too high for Mahomes?
Time to boycott these wings.

Jerry did not want Romo to win a Superbowl anywhere else besides of Dallas.
They're salty !
Jerry hated on his greatness... wouldn't let him start and chock last year because some young dude was outplaying him...
Lol. He could have played for the @HoustonTexans but Jerry did not want that.

85% of passengers on airlines have no etiquitte dr is a prime example
think the "doctor" needed a bit of maturity-strange how a grown man could act that way-he is at fault
Any Panthers fans out there!? My @HoustonTexans in the city for the 1st preseason game so whats up let's link up
the so called dr is an embarassment to drs-he was at fault crazy man

Out of all bad decisions I have seen companies make this is one of the top 10 ever! I could guide UA better than current ceo
United CEO and leadership all need fired tomorrow. How a management team of such a large company can be so ignorant is unblievable

That's why I fly American most of the time. I'm not sure I've ever been on a United flight.
@HoustonTexans vs @dallascowboys should be a yearly regular season non divisional game not a preseason game @NFL
Had 11.5 sacks under DC wade phillips in @HoustonTexans back in 2011 & will benefit from switch back to 3-4 OLB from 4-3 DE
Very possible it could've been standby. Haven't heard any real details yet. Maybe this guy could claim discrimination . Y did they pick him?
The friendly sky's that volunteers you to leave the plane for their employees to fly then batter the person and calls them belligerent
Absolutely disgusting. This airline needs to be shut down!
This doctor had a patient waiting for him. He did not deserve to be treated like this. Damn you @united
CEO apologized for “having to reaccommodate these customers.” Really? Company's actions and their response inhumane. #volunteertoflydelta
Yeah!! Lawsuit!!!
Jamie just curious but how come the Texans background instead of the Ravens??
When you have so much money and become so powerful and treat people like commodities it's time to show United who pays the bills. Boycott!!
F United
@HoustonTexans @Seahawks trade Sherman make a new deal, Ik Sherman & a 2018 2nd round pick for Clowney benefits both teams #TRADE !!! Do it!!
Right. Disgusting but not surprising anymore.
Looked crazy. First class, next flight, $500.00 voucher, I'm up. I'm betting now, this guy was flying standby.
I am sure that united escalated situation & there were multiple personnel there who probably didn't even understand y an assault occurred.
I'm sorry. I mispelled f*ck off.
Police were watching, but the person who assaulted the man looked almost like tarmac personnel.
I've seen mahomes live, on tv, in draft breakdowns, pro day, combine etc I've seen enough of him TBH lmao
I ain't watch no QBs other than mahomes lol
Pay what?

#1 on my personal board yes
You confident in him?
Cops, TSA are more like Security Officers with no powers of arrest.
I want them to trade up for trubisky. Obviously they not gonna listen or respond and the social media intern ain't the GM but yeag
Wasn't United legging were American an never let them on. Free fliers because of family employee. Violated dress requirement. Pay attension.
???
This makes me so upset! That poor man I feel so sorry 4 him
Those were TSA or cops.
He did... he bought his ticket arrived on time was seated then refused to give up his seat 4 a late arriving united employee! #assbeat
Can't wait to cover the @houstontexans this Fall ・・・ Our 2017 preseason schedule is set. #WeAreTexans pic.twitter.com/oRuDGOsavn
Not much choice down here, but there HAS to be more to the story.
He should've went Bruce Lee, Jet Li or Jackie Chan on them! Fight or flight! No pun intended!!
I will never step on a United flt again!
Fly the Abusive skies!
Could they sign #TheAndre for one game and have him play an actual down in one of the preseason games? That would be spectacular. I’d go.
I won't be flying United anymore! I hope the doctor sues the crap out of them!

That was to much fun!
@dallascowboys preseason schedule HoF Game vs @AZCardinals W1 at @RamsNFL W2 vs @IndianpolisC W3 vs @RAIDERS W4 at @HoustonTexans
Lufthansa Great service, ground and air staff Good choice within Europe imho
No doubt! @HoustonTexans NOLA part two!!!!
fvck united
I hope he got his $100 voucher for giving up his seat
Not really since we don't have an established QB
Disgraceful.
Ya momma 0-16 boi
I need to try Lufthansa.

BOYCOTT UNITED NOW !!!!!!
#BoycottUnitedAirlines
@HoustonTexans There's NO reason y'all shouldn't give @Kaepernick7 a chance.
Better let your friends know to use up their miles before United becomes divided.
Life a box of chocolates,,,,
Me either.
Air Canada here, there and everywhere w/Star Alliance airlines for local flights eg Munich Zurich w/Lufthansa. Not that I'm biased
None of whom will ever see another dime of my money.
Ha! Hopefully nice beaches, hot sun, and cold drinks. Cheers!
Y'all will go 0-16 #WeDemBoyz

Well that's not what actually happened with the leggings... With free ride comes rules to be followed. Not the same situation.
preseason is like y'all postseason.
My jetting days are behind me, but nonetheless this is useful info for many. And, re jetting days...who knows?
i have used @united in the past but never again.
Flying in Cda...westjet,,,Europe is Lufftansa,,,lots of leg room..
@HoustonTexans we got a great defense we need a one heck of a quarterback can we get one Houston fans can we blow up Twitter Texans adm.OFCS https:// twitter.com/HoustonTexans/ status/851578050802139136 …
I don't fly Air Canada either. I use West Jet in Canada and Hawaii. British Airways overseas to London & Israel.
That you're never flying United again is awesome news. Hopefully my modicum of Air Canada stocks will increase in value?
Terrible mishandling! Just TERRIBLE! Rules of overbooking-- whoever gets in the seat FIRST, gets the seat! Right?
With you there one time flying is enough I'll drive.

Not behind the Oline that couldn't keep oswieler upright stars would be aligned for him to get hurt and end the season. On the DL.

There are many great Law Enforcement Officers out there and most never have to draw their weapon or let alone shoot someone
Is that how people act in China? Throw temper tantrums?
yes, but I don't think this was the case. Failed to comply, forcibly removed. No gun, taser, club, just dragged off.
Oh yeah.
Anyways I do support Law Enforcement Officers but there are a few bad apples out there not many.
think tha woman in the hiijab 2 rows up "Volunteered" him actually...
I take it your not a Military Veteran then other wise you would know what a MOS is
My Military job was Military Police nothing fancy about it I spent most of my time at the Gates
Ima wear a hijab to stay safe
Agree 100% and they should have!!
Come on Football season! I'm ready to watch my Texans hit the field! @HoustonTexans @JJWatt @debbiethetexan @TexansChica @Nukdabomb
United could of put its Employees on another Air Lines and saved everyone the trouble.
MOS?
My MOS was 31-B I would tell United Airlines employees to do their own dirty work and I would walk myself off the plane.
Sure, very possible. Notice how everyone quick with their camera phones, but NO ONE quick to stand up and volunteer. Think about that.
Discusting!!! Buh bye United!
pic.twitter.com/pea9NiFEGv
Not all Police Officers would be willing to drag a man off the plane for not giving up his seat. I would tell them to choose another person
Makes you wonder about them having a random passenger generator.
You guys r my team but this preseason could stop us before we get started. Lets build mental toughness in prep4the preseason losses. #boost
Already added them to my boycott list. Over charge and over book then offer next to nothing. No takers call the cops.
Fly Alaska Airlines or Delta Airlines but never fly United Airlines unless your into S&M, free beatings on every flight.
Stop, or I'll say stop again! To what point should one go before using force?
put on leave until investigation is typical. He will be back as he did nothing wrong.
Terrible incident.
Boycott @united and sue @united until it bankrupted.
And a wrong way to do the job the Police Officer is not a credit to the men in blue.
Really the Police Officer was suspended after this, hopefully he will be fired for his actions, there is a right way to do this job.
So will @JJWatt play in the preseason? If so, I can't WAIT to see him sack Tom Brady and Cam Newton!
I already wasn't flying United https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4z Oqozo …
Sure, it's a quick paycheck. You know as well as I do that the Browns are pretty much where reputations & careers more or less are over.
#neverflyUnited @united try @AlaskaAir !
My dog is a better quarterback than jay cutler
He'll be compensated. Don't feel too bad for him. Might even get paid extra because it is Cleveland.
Employees should be terminated!!

I've been from Memphis to NYNY or D.C. several times all in my rental. My time, my money, my casual drive.(non-stop)
NO, this is how someone gets removed when failing to comply with law enforcement.
what was the Pepsi PR blunder?

Can we say "Boycott"? I can...Ya need a weapon on board to be safe. Sorry for that poor man...
Where's Kendall Jenner with an ultra calming PEPSI when you really need her?
I will never fly United after that bullshit....Ive had trouble with them but never to that extent! They purposely overbook ! BS! Boycott
Good Lord....
That's fucked up
this is not a volunteer work！ #unitedAIRLINES
@HoustonTexans should sign Jay Cutler. Would be a solid pickup and they could improve to losing to the Patriots in the AFC championship game
Wallet closed
Why do I think the folks at @Pepsi are relieved today.
I know it's preseason but y'all got 3 teams I don't like so PLZ WHOOP THEM! #WeAreTexans
Take the $800 and smile or this will happen to you.
Bright side is he will soon have YUGE stock options in united airlines.
Tony Romo is likened to (not as Great) as the Old Peyton Manning (Great Regular Season...Oops December/PostSeason) Better than Jay Cutler!
First they kicked off a girl for leggings..then banned leggings...now they kick the shit outta asians for not "VOLUNTEERING" good job united
The new Airlines .. give them an inch they take a mile on authority...
United has sunk to a new low- terrible for more than 25 years
Will not fly unless absolutely required, I'll drive 18hrs first.
#please #stop
They probably could say he was interfering with the flight, failure to obey flight attendants, etc... imagine the fine print on ticket.
They should go bankrupt over this IMO.

Actually, no. Most drafts put him behind Kizer/Trubisky, and the teams who may pick up QBs would be Saints/Browns/Charger n 2 rly dont gotta

Well at least they tossed him before the took off
This is horrible. Poor guy.
Exactly!!!
Not so much while on the ground.
Who's mans is this
Best be finding a quarterback or don't bother to book any airline tickets losers.
Still,they take him out and he runs back in the air plane screaming?
On the flip side, when security asks you to get up and exit. You go. Dude got the snot knocked out & probably could be charged
Good comp to get us ready
@HoustonTexans are just as bad, shame

Happy birthday Kareem!
So we have 17 days till the draft and we still haven't even looked at a QB!? What are we doing @HoustonTexans
@HoustonTexans this is our guy. Everyone is panicking about it. Stay calm make the move and watch him do the magic!! #ATrueWinner
Houston Texans you need to trade up in the draft you have the 25th pick the quarterback you want may not be there
Looks like VS We'll know at 5 PM @HoustonTexans @Lions VS @Giants
I don't think that because they won. I think that because I feel like they have just s bit better team. Defense is good and got weapons
@HoustonTexans I'd say look to the bayou to solve our QB issue I heard there's a TX boy sitting in New Orleans with a heavy cap number
Goal is to make ALL games this year!
I just think Giants got a better team
Just cuz the Giants swept us in one season doesn't mean anything. We swept them 2 years ago so this isn't gonna be a regular thing
Will lose to Giants tho.
True that!
Serious question....Tony Romo was officially released by Dallas when he said he's going to CBS. What are the @HoustonTexans doing?
10-6 actually isn't bad actually but I'll expect at least a 11-5 season from them

@HoustonTexans there's no reason we shouldn't be able to draft Josh Reynolds, 4th round?
Prescott and Elliot with have sophomore slump. 10-6 for Cowboys this yesr
We had a great team this year. Texans are relevant due to defense
That's like saying if the colts had a good defense they would win and have rings . But we don't and neither do you
They're lucky they are in a weaker division. The defense if healthy can help bail them out regardless of choice
Savage. Unless they want to take a flier on Kaepernick, which would bolster their offense a bit IMO.

@HoustonTexans The O-Line needs work. Sign a QB that can adapt to it... Kaepernick's the best option. This man went 2 a SB 4 goodness sake.

Listening to HC Bill O'Brien @HoustonTexans at the Alabama Clinic. This guy is really good! I can see why players like playing for him.
Imagine how much better these stats would be if he had good qb
Have they done anything with that money that's opened up though? Believe I read Brock only has money guaranteed to him through this season
I don't regret getting osweiler off the books
Hey @culturemap those @HoustonTexans SuperFans look familiar!!! @TexansCheer @HTC_Speaker pic.twitter.com/e2KvDBpB7C
I don't think it's outside realm of possibility tbh. I do think there are bigger needs because we have those 3. But, I'm not ruling it out
Y'all should've just let us rip you off and gave us Watt @HoustonTexans
Texans always go best player available. What are the chances TJ Watt ends up with 90,99, and 59?
Realization: The @HoustonTexans trade Osweiler and a 2nd round pick to clear room for Romo, who then decided to retire......
I would like to see @RGIII or @Kaepernick7 as the QB for the @HoustonTexans
@HTC_Yuki help us! @HoustonTexans to the rescue! #DonQuixote #PanchoSanchez A team born of the #South but still in the #NorthernHemisphere .
Could not agree more. People have a hard time agreeing to disagree. Much appreciated as well!
And by appreciate it, I meant I appreciate the conversation and the civil back and forth (that doesn't happen much on this medium
As long as 59, 99 & 90 are playing D, nothing is dire, even QB situation. Is it optimum? No, clearly not but it'll improve. Appreciate it.
I don't share your optimism with Savage at all and I do think it is dire. We will see. I really hope you are right!! Thanks for your incite
Same amount since 2002 bud. Just saying cowboys haven't been relevant since the 90s
Am I happy with Savage to start? I'm not disappointed like others because I think he can do good things. But, draft one too and let's go.
Finding right QB hasn't been easy for many teams unless they had 1 or 2 overall in a year w/bonafide players (Luck, Mariota, Winston)
Look at drafts recently (which I'm working on now, so it's fresh on my brain) there haven't been a ton of QBs that would even be options.
I don't think it's a dire situation, I don't think it's the best thing in the world situation. It was a joke, but QB don't grow on trees...
Yes. What are your thoughts?
You sure?
Just seems like we have no plan. Savage for sure is not the answer.
You have a quarterback tree in your backyard? We could use one, my man.
Titties ass. Ass titties. Repeat.
Beautifully Ladies. May your dreams come true
2/2 ...Because, from my view, the @HoustonTexans own Houston's sports media and their lunch $.
Address why the @HoustonTexans are less than honest with the media/fans in regards to dysfunction between the GM and head coach? #skeered
Calling it right now: @DeshaunWatson4 drafted by @HoustonTexans , era of cold-blooded-Clemson-connection to @Nukdabomb begins now.
Well he's had it since Christmas. I don't really follow football other than the @HoustonTexans , but you could ask him.
@HoustonTexans If you guys draft either Mahomes or QB from Tenesse and allow them to learn from Kaep you guys will go to superbowl.
@HoustonTexans Kaepernick at QB. They can't load the box or double hopkins. They also have to account for Miller.
UR WELCOME LUV, U GOT THIS
When are we getting a real QB? Will it be before we waste the best D in the league?
Olivia W, Megan K, Mallory M, but if I can only choose 1 girl Olivia W down, she is 1 of the most beautiful woman have seen Hope U win!

The @HoustonTexans need to fire R. Smith. They've never had an elite QB and this guy still hasn't drafted a QB higher than the 4th Rd. #NFL
@PayneNFL @MikeMeltser especially considering the fact that the @HoustonTexans best QB was Schaub. Good for a while but not elite. #NFL

Which team would be the best fit for @TarHeelFootball QB Mitchell Trubisky? @nflnetwork discusses the options. : http:// bit.ly/2oFhNS0 pic.twitter.com/pIHtieGiZl
I can't wait till y'all go 0-16
Tom Savage is not the answer for the @HoustonTexans going forward. In this podcast, I explain why. #NFL http:// topssports.com/tom-savage-is- not-the-answer-for-the-texans-at-the-quarterback-position/ … pic.twitter.com/ZohMQH02D6
Cowboys 13-3, 5 rings, offense, team. Texans 8-8, 0 rings, JJ watt and that's it. Hahahahahahahahaha you're a joke
Hahaha what a joke!
Ummm excuse me???? U are wrong about that !
Since I'm one for one on @HoustonTexans GM calls this year, wtf are you guys doing not signing Cutler right now?
I feel for you. If an average qb could just throw you the ball for a few season you will be #1 in the NFL. Hang in there we love u #Texans
Yooooooooo
I can't wait till game day.
Good to know!!!! #wearetexans

YUHHH
You are wasting your prime years, so sorry.
Lmao these random ass records
well then shame on OB and the @HoustonTexans for hiring an employee without meeting face to face first
I'm from Houston, love Houston sports but @FixYourLife is right. The @HoustonTexans and Bill O are complete trash. Deal with it, Texas fans
Smerjjjlsiijsfjeie

@HoustonTexans we should sign boldin for real tho ...cheap veteran presence for hop miller fuller? Why not
@HoustonTexans bring in @Kaepernick7 We need a solid QB, he's it. Forget all the outside noise and focus on our needs!! A friggin QB!!!!
I love those lol, i was hoping to see these mumbles once again

Hard for me to say as @HoustonTexans fan, but maybe pass on a QB this year and draft Josh Allen from Wyoming in '18 Draft
@LanceZierlein I count only 7 players on the @HoustonTexans that were drafted by the team and have received a new contract/extension.
How is that turn heel? That's growing a pair of nuts that the organization has lacked from day 1.

@drewbrees should ask to be traded to the @HoustonTexans
