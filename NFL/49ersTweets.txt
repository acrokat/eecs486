Best day ever and to this day my favorite QB ever. I was in elementary school but I was an instant fan. Thx dad for teaching me football
A un tal Joe Montana... que hizo de bueno? Además de 4 anillos de SB ??? EL MEJOR DE TODOS Y DE TODOS LOS TIEMPOS!! Aunque se enojen algunos
Colin said mechanics don't matter. Instead of trying to work to become Drew Brees. He wants to be a worse version of Alex Smith
¡Faltan 16 días para el #NFLDraft ! En 1979 los @49ers seleccionaron a @JoeMontana en la 3a ronda. El mejor ️ ️ http:// 49rs.co/1Vq0H2 pic.twitter.com/W5DCVfYzqJ
That super bowl was 3 years ago and the NFL didn't know who he was. After the NFL figured him out he has been garbage since
He led his to a Super Bowl...Hoyer hasn't done anything and he has gotten multiple opportunities
I hope the @49ers have an open practice again! I had so much fun last year. #GoNiners pic.twitter.com/axJ7NzuE8e
As a passer what does Kaepernick do better than Hoyer??? As a athlete Kap is way better but as a passer??
Are you making the draft party this year ?
@49ers Kaepernick is better than every QB on your roster...the reason Shanahan gave is BS
I heard that guy was pretty good.
The year I became a Niner fan!
16 days until the #NFLDraft ! In 1979, the #49ers drafted @JoeMontana in the 3rd round. The best of ️ ️ http:// 49rs.co/1Vq0H2 pic.twitter.com/zBynTO0ibK

No thanks, they had the man beat because he refused to "volunteer" to give up his seat for an employee.

@49ers I'm telling y'all... draft John Ross...
LOL yeah...
How is he full of bs?
The tickets 4 @raiders games in 2016 were more expensive in Oakland then any ticket at the new @49ers stadium. Remember that
@49ers Your head coach is full of bs when it comes to KAEPERNICK. So racism has always been in the NFL . Sound like the KKK 2 me.
Wow
Can anyone tell me why @49ers will be taking a defensive linemen with the second pick? I feel they have two solid outside rushers already.

This man got in position and has been working hard from day one. Much respect to the new coach.
@blaseresvi4444 @49ers
Malcolm smith and Bowman will be scary
2nd round better be all defense.
Hello
We coming up that's all I know ! We back on the rise
Just imagine if we get Watson with Shanahan offense
Cause kaepernick was cooking on the low & josh is rough he just got to put the blunt down for a season
Don't sleep on Josh Gordon if he can come back clean
Just the offense we was running was terrible . We had the top 5 running offense in league .
Him too but Kirk cousins is not a winner bro . His WRs made him look good .
Our OL is terrible though
We waisted our last two picks on DL and it didn't help
Kirk is clean bro don't sleep on him
We really need Williams from Clemson ! He nasty
Kirk Cousins is not good without WRs . We need a QB and safety
Myles forsure but if browns take him then OL we need it . Kirk cousins coming next year we don't need a QB
Who should we get first then
2nd round though
We better land him @49ers pic.twitter.com/0VCA0vWJ0Z

Omg! @aserious49erfan @Hslof
Exactly he opted out because if he didn't they were going to release him anyways...wow how many times do I have to say this?
i would not fly with @united after that i bet the guy sues @united
Faithful for life Bow!
I will never ever again fly on a United flight I will have to change my Airline but that's okay I won't get beat up wanting to get home
So much respect for this guy already!! May have to consider purchasing his jersey since all the ones I have, are no longer w/ the @49ers
Can't wait for the season to start & see you back out there !! Niner faithful forever !!
Honesty so excited to see you back in Cali, it's about as close to seeing you back in SC colors as we can get
He opted out so he left the Niners not the other way round
So good to see you back and ready to kick ass and Win games @NBowman53 Can't wait to you run out that #Levisstadium tunnel again pic.twitter.com/OFMiGEdwIT

United should be bankrupt in 6 months becsuse of no one willing to fly the combative sky's with them. Dint need a boycot just common sense
Out of all bad decisions I have seen companies make this is one of the top 10 ever! I could guide UA better than current ceo
United CEO and leadership all need fired tomorrow. How a management team of such a large company can be so ignorant is unblievable
Imagine how things go when you fly the unfriendly skies
Evil Corporate: Oh yeah! We're advertising with dead people as the main focal point! Nothing can go wrong! Nothing will! pic.twitter.com/avustuz2gW
We will never fly that airline again I'll drive first !
Ha! All about my Texans!
Though I must admit...I'm a bit offended you didn't include my @49ers in your poll!
Wish younothing but the best Matt...knock'em dead. Fight On.
Finally! Welcome back guys!! It's great to see you!! Love to see you happy best wishes 4incredible success!! #theFaithful #alwaysbelieve

@katherineygarza !!!
Let translate to the field
agree, a lot worse quarterback being signed.
any reason why coach S. never seems to wear 49er logo stuff?
Trent Baalke used to ALWAYS celebrate this during the NFL draft. "Superstar on the board?, Next" #DraftingBustSince2012
This is a doctor... just imagine how they'd fuck up a lawyer?!
No real details yet. I am sure the world is desperately waiting for some answers!
Or he could have just walked off the plane . The end, no story here.
@49ers please pickup @JabrillPeppers
I completely disagree, especially considering how inferior QB's like Matt Barkley and Nick Foles are able to find work
That's why I fly @SouthwestAir . #united @Marketplace
What do we know about the captain of this flight? Was he condoning this?
NOT FLYING THE FRIENDLY SKIES WITH UNITED
Kaepernick could be great with a coach who understands his abilities and weaknesses!
Not a big deal lol. I'm just saying if that's even close to true, not even 100% true, it makes sense for PHI to take McGloin for 3rd string
Yup, and much deserved too. #GoodRiddanceKaep
Me seeing an article completely contradicting my argument... pic.twitter.com/NXgS6505Gn
Lmao
Nah not with the drafts for 49ers, they got some great new players!
69 year old doctor this is sickening
Perfect!
FYI, the @UnitedAirlines twitter handle has been disabled and locked. It was active a few hours ago. Use @united instead. It is support
LMAO
@49ers draft jake butt
It is a stupid policy
Just like ISIS randomly chooses victims to execute
I don't know if I trust an ESPN reporter, but if this is true, it's foolish on Kaep's part. Although after what Mike Glennon got...
Is that what you call what the NFL owners are doing to Colin Kaepernick despite the fact that worse QB's are getting signed?

I don't think he's made any demands. If he had, we would have heard about it

#preseason @49ers - @Chiefs @Broncos @Vikings and @Chargers #OMG
Probably illegal or sleeper cell anyway
I like it ... It will test the new @49ers
That's why I'm thinking standby. Jury is still out.
Its amazin that @Kaepernick7 is unsigned. @49ers use the guise other teams not wanting to change their offensive schemes. #BlackBalled him
Gotta luv #the45ths racist america #BoycottUnitedAirlines
That's why I fly American most of the time. I'm not sure I've ever been on a United flight.
Very possible it could've been standby. Haven't heard any real details yet. Maybe this guy could claim discrimination . Y did they pick him?
The friendly sky's that volunteers you to leave the plane for their employees to fly then batter the person and calls them belligerent
Absolutely disgusting. This airline needs to be shut down!
This doctor had a patient waiting for him. He did not deserve to be treated like this. Damn you @united
CEO apologized for “having to reaccommodate these customers.” Really? Company's actions and their response inhumane. #volunteertoflydelta
Yeah!! Lawsuit!!!
When you have so much money and become so powerful and treat people like commodities it's time to show United who pays the bills. Boycott!!
F United
Right. Disgusting but not surprising anymore.
Looked crazy. First class, next flight, $500.00 voucher, I'm up. I'm betting now, this guy was flying standby.
I have a good vibrations! #goniners
I am sure that united escalated situation & there were multiple personnel there who probably didn't even understand y an assault occurred.
I'm sorry. I mispelled f*ck off.
Police were watching, but the person who assaulted the man looked almost like tarmac personnel.
Pay what?
Looking forward to seeing you guys soon!

Very nice, Thank You Jed York
McGloin also signed to be a 3rd string QB. Kaepernick is probably expecting to be at least 2nd string and get more money.
Cops, TSA are more like Security Officers with no powers of arrest.
Wasn't United legging were American an never let them on. Free fliers because of family employee. Violated dress requirement. Pay attension.
This makes me so upset! That poor man I feel so sorry 4 him
Biggest thing to takeaway from the start of the @49ers offseason program? 100% attendance. Players are committed. #brickbybrick
Those were TSA or cops.
He did... he bought his ticket arrived on time was seated then refused to give up his seat 4 a late arriving united employee! #assbeat

think tha woman in the hiijab 2 rows up "Volunteered" him actually...
I take it your not a Military Veteran then other wise you would know what a MOS is
True but he won't matter he's gonna stay his simple butt in the shadows now watch
My Military job was Military Police nothing fancy about it I spent most of my time at the Gates
Ima wear a hijab to stay safe
Agree 100% and they should have!!
United could of put its Employees on another Air Lines and saved everyone the trouble.
MOS?
My MOS was 31-B I would tell United Airlines employees to do their own dirty work and I would walk myself off the plane.
Sure, very possible. Notice how everyone quick with their camera phones, but NO ONE quick to stand up and volunteer. Think about that.
Discusting!!! Buh bye United!
Trade up for Garrett
Feel like alot will depend on how our Draft goes and what we do at QB but got a good feeling about that as well

Not all Police Officers would be willing to drag a man off the plane for not giving up his seat. I would tell them to choose another person
Still have the same owner though

Stop, or I'll say stop again! To what point should one go before using force?
put on leave until investigation is typical. He will be back as he did nothing wrong.
Terrible incident.
Boycott @united and sue @united until it bankrupted.
And a wrong way to do the job the Police Officer is not a credit to the men in blue.
Really the Police Officer was suspended after this, hopefully he will be fired for his actions, there is a right way to do this job.

Are you ready for some football? @49ers & @RAIDERS announce preseason schedules. http:// cbsloc.al/2o1op9l
Considering how big a name Kaep has become, I can't imagine he has. Someone would have reported it.
Do you know if he's been offered a job? Maybe someone offered him a backup job for 6 per and he said no? I have no idea. Do you?
That is absolutely true. Angel Pagan wasn't signed because he expects to start and get a guaranteed contract. I doubt Kaep has same demands
Why do I think the folks at @Pepsi are relieved today.
Backup QBs have different roles than starters. It's not all about talent. And before I judge anyone, I want to know his terms & expectations
Playing the best division in the @NFL (AFC WEST) & you missing out playing against the best team y'all scared of us @49ers #RaiderNation https:// twitter.com/49ers/status/8 51543754062393345 …
Matt McGloin sucks much more than Kaep. Teams that sign shittier QBs, like the @49ers signing Matt Barkley are going to get called out.
That'll do it.
Take the $800 and smile or this will happen to you.
@49ers I LOVE YOU

welcome, but PLEASE change your number.
@49ers no running back should wear 21 ever again, why would you try? Shit give it to a corner if anything
@49ers would love to have Myles Garrett fall to them at #2. Let the @Browns be the browns @richeisen . Lol

IMO the @49ers should give 21 to Lattimore or Hooker. That number would look good on either respectively.
@49ers don't ever disrespect frank gore like that.. f is wrong with you!!

Looks like we need a new equipment manager because apparently he doesn't know Niners history
As a @49ers fan, I fully endorse the Browns' decision to take Fournette #1.

And I *might* be able to break 5.0 in the 40 these days.
Because you're 6'4" and have soft hands like a lady, you're more likely to be drafted in the 7th than to make the pick.
Ask how many for all 11!
According to @walterfootball , @94_GHOST will get selected 5th round by the @49ers . @94_GHOST & @Mantis_954 on defense together pic.twitter.com/sf6YxFSJHZ
