@Eagles Why is Ryan Matthew still on our roster?
@Eagles fans need to forget this McCaffrey talk... they need to target @Showtyme_29 ... he will be a LEGIT NFL running back! Runs hard.
GL man, the Nation appreciates ur time in Oakland. Always a gamer!
The @Eagles will be looking for hidden gems on Day Three of the @NFL Draft, writes @kracze http:// bit.ly/2o2aUoU
With this pace he'll be signed as an @Eagles backup QB in no time.

You just ma'am me nigga
Why you so aggressive Robert?
@Eagles Josh Gordon why not ?
@Eagles our first round pick, and a 3rd for Sherman.
Really hope not bro. Not worth it.
Carry on ma'am
That's not our style or Douglas' I wouldn't worry
But the show itself isn't.
@MikeVick let me get that follow back.. you are my favorite player I miss you on the @Eagles pic.twitter.com/6hAnnhAnQ4

@Eagles trade that first rounder for Sherman
Thank you for this I will be at both home games this season
Looks like 4-0 to me
Rice ways overlooked.
Not risk**
He was a 3rd rd pick before the combine, but cause he's 6'3 200lbs ran a 4.43. We have to nail this pick, by risk it on a project
@Eagles https:// twitter.com/Lilgeeeeee/sta tus/851911725028958209 …
I'm sure there going to be shakeups always was and always will be with @Steelers @Eagles
He was UWs 3rd best DB lol
Thankfully someone agreed with me

Depending on #of starters and roster size that might not be too bad. And the low(er) cost of the 1.02 should give you a better balance.
The Eagles have the same amount of Super Bowls as the Falcons
I am just afraid McCaffrey is going to get the snot knocked out of him with his size and be injury plagued. @ChrisCarlin @Ike58Reese @Eagles
Hopefully the @Eagles don't reach at 14 if there's no corner there take best available player period
He came with a $29m price for 2yr but I had the room. Owner who traded him had 1st 3 picks & not enough cap to sign them all, so I went 4 it

Can't root for a team if your not born there that's Iggle fans logic
Iggles fans hate guys like you must be born in Philly to like the Iggles
Thought everyone hated preseason football ? but cool advertise it
Should the @Eagles go All-In and trade for Sherman W/ a 1st, 3rd & 4th?
@RapSheet should the @Eagles go All-In and trade for Sherman W/ a 1st, 3rd & 4th?
@Eagles listen closely ... Reuben Foster, Corey Davis or Marlon Humphries 1st round
Oh that's a steal! You were never going to get a talent like Jeffery at 1.09/1.10 and the 1.02 is the cherry on top. pic.twitter.com/Nxa3B420oy

You're wild Holmes
Still don't know why the @eagles play the jets in pre season every year. #flyeaglesfly #eagles
Stay away from @cj_wentz he's on pace to be a franchise QB. Don't try to teach him anything u know.. thanks #FlyEaglesFly
Yea I just saw it on BR.
Is this a rumor going around?
#EaglesCareSummit is trending???? What do the @Eagles care about?!?!? Obviously not winning the Vince Lombardi trophy in the near future
Then we wouldn't have to focus on corner til the 3rd honestly. Get a RB and MLB or DE
***BREAKING NFL DRAFT NEWS*** First look @Eagles Official Draft Board. See what Roseman & Douglas are planning with the 14th overall pick. pic.twitter.com/bgspNPTWrp
I would give up a 4th in a second.
And he's younger than Sherman and cheaper
@GovChristie ? #Bridgegate ? #EaglesCoverUp ? & #Tentgate ? pic.twitter.com/q95itHRZfv
We could definitely get him for a 4th and let's remember he has no help in cle. No one could be with that defense. Low risk High reward
I wouldn't give up too much he's lost a step. Still good though I would take him for a reasonable price.
You can watch the @Eagles preseason right here on #NBC10 http:// on.nbc10.com/qdjo4Kl pic.twitter.com/U2c0UpWTax
Especially when My @Eagles run on dunkin all day
I love it 100%
Trading for Joe Haden is way better move for the @eagles what you think @cbarnesrun
HEY LOOK !!! Its an Eagles SB Trophy !!!!
Yeah I know, I'm just not willing to part with a 1st or 2nd round pick.
This needs to happen in California @Eagles
This is gonna be a good year I can see it coming #StriveForGreatness
They want more than that but I like where your heads at
Ahhh Saints fans still bitter Lol
#PqVcTemTwitter É só pra ler e postar coisa sobre FA e o @Eagles msm..
I certainly hope so, just traded 1.09, 1.10 for 1.02, Jeffery. Jeffery is 2nd highest paid wr in the league so owner had to dump him for cap

I think that's what they'll definitely do. But idk which one
True that...we prolly draft one
We need a RB. Not kid cudi

Congratulations!! My husband (West Scranton HS '76) is freakin excited!
Looking for four Tickets to preseason @packers vs. @Eagles
Unfortunately I agree with everything you just said
All 4 are outliers at the moment. Aldon Smith has been given many chances. Teammate of Kaep. Meanwhile, Kaep has fought for human rights
Greg Hardy was signed by the Cowboys. Peterson will be signed by someone. Rice beat the shit out of his girlfriend on video. Brown is a K.
Not a big deal lol. I'm just saying if that's even close to true, not even 100% true, it makes sense for PHI to take McGloin for 3rd string
Me seeing an article completely contradicting my argument... pic.twitter.com/NXgS6505Gn
This should cause some major Sunday traffic on I-476 south. #ScrantonToPhilly
welcome to the team fam see you soon
You are probably right. I wasn't even looking at their depth chart. Just the fact that McGloin < Kaep.
I have no clue lol
I don't know if I trust an ESPN reporter, but if this is true, it's foolish on Kaep's part. Although after what Mike Glennon got...
Look bud...I know all these things already and agree with you. But the eagles were never going to be a fit for him which was my point.
He silently protest by sitting, kneeling, wearing controversial socks & a T-Shirt. Meanwhile, countless other guys beat their wives, etc...
http://www. cbssports.com/nfl/news/colin -kaepernick-reportedly-wants-9-10-million-per-year-and-a-chance-to-start/ …
Nolan Carrolls dad
This agency looks to be around 2 weeks old?
His numbers were decent. The perception might be he has an attitude, but reality is that his 49ers teammates gave him award for his attitude
I don't think he's made any demands. If he had, we would have heard about it
Kaep > McGloin. Another terrible QB gets a job before Kaep. That's all.
I don't think he's expecting to go somewhere to compete. I think he expects to be 2nd string. Nobody has said he's looking to start
So sad to see you leave the Raiders but I wish you the best of luck!
Daw stop laughing all the time bo!!
Go for it
Mets fan all day bro
I mean...they drafted Wentz 2nd overall, so not exactly looking for someone to come in and compete with him.
Weak move by @Cubs in stealing #Rocky theme from #Philly for their pre-game ceremony. @Eagles @sixers @Phillies @NHLFlyers #GetYourOwnSong !!
If they are, great. If they aren't and signed McGloin instead. Pretty sad
Yes an incredible opportunity that once again your never gonna play . Best of luck to you pic.twitter.com/FLwnBWMJ8q
don't believe so
He's a PA product, signing to be a backup and hold a clipboard for Carson Wentz. Not sure why you think the Eagles would be in on Kaepernick
Rocker true hater!!
I am a huge PSU fan and Eagles fan. So happy you are back in PA. #PSU AND #Eagles
McGloin also signed to be a 3rd string QB. Kaepernick is probably expecting to be at least 2nd string and get more money.
Can 'we' wear throwback uniforms for preseason games? Wish team would try to find workarounds like @Eagles tried at Owners Meeting.
ITS GONNA BE A LIT ASS YEAR. CANT WAIT FOR THE #NFLDraft IN #PHIL . HOME OF THE @Eagles

Considering how big a name Kaep has become, I can't imagine he has. Someone would have reported it.
Do you know if he's been offered a job? Maybe someone offered him a backup job for 6 per and he said no? I have no idea. Do you?
That is absolutely true. Angel Pagan wasn't signed because he expects to start and get a guaranteed contract. I doubt Kaep has same demands
can't wait big things gonna happen
Backup QBs have different roles than starters. It's not all about talent. And before I judge anyone, I want to know his terms & expectations
@PlayStation Hey I have an idea ok in madden let's say I chose @Eagles but the light turns Green or red for @Chiefs what u think pic.twitter.com/msRp1h4er7
Matt McGloin sucks much more than Kaep. Teams that sign shittier QBs, like the @49ers signing Matt Barkley are going to get called out.

2 word descriptions aren't accurate
Where winners are made
Matt McGloin is starting an undefeated preseason streak
4-0
Yeah and the last 2 have been enough to call him injury prone he's great when on the field great deep ball wr when he's healthy tho
Its a rb, not halfback
The lions best wr had just over 1k yards, while their #3 wr had over 100 yards last year. Those 4 all would easily surpass 100 lmao
Am I wrong about those guys tho I never said they were trash I never said my wr were better just facts about those guys
He was satcastic
He was cheap
3rd stringer who brings some competition to camp. We don't have to worry about drafting one,
Really you know or you're just salty about facts and talk out your ass cuz you definitely said Tate was trash before you got corrected
we are the defending preseason champs so....yeah
AFC East much...

Jets Every Preseason
trying*
A guy that hasn't played ball in what 2 years is better lol a guy that is in the top of wr with drops and a return man are better lol
stop arguing im type to bust a nut
Hmm #FlyEaglesFly #Eagles
Week 4 as always lol
3 of his 5 seasons he didn't miss a single game due to injury. In the other 2 he missed a combined 13 games
Hes a 3rd string QB
The exact dates and times will be announced in the future. All games will be broadcast on @NBCPhiladelphia and @SportsRadioWIP .

I would make fun of this @BleacherReport story on the @Eagles siging McGloin, but I'm a @Browns fan, so .. http:// bleacherreport.com/articles/26878 81-ex-raiders-qb-matt-mcgloin-signs-1-year-contract-with-eagles …
@Eagles can you please draft @dc_wilson954
Thank god he's a bum
BINGO! I loved watching that guy play. He was really good in so many ways. I've recently read where he felt he never reached his potential.
what are the radio stations gonna piss and moan about for the next 3 months without a QB controversy and missed workouts?
@Eagles I'm really gonna need to do me a solid and draft Christian McCaffrey
He's not a #2. He is horrible and will be our of the league in 3 years
Dwight "Dewey" Evans the most underrated player in @MLB History.
I can't wait! Let's go! #FlyEaglesFly
He will not be a 3rd guy. He will be cut before the end of camp.

Congratulations to our client @McGloinQB11 for signing with the @Eagles !!! #hometownhero #FlyEaglesFly pic.twitter.com/zNKQ4HH4Pw
So this is where the super bowl streak begins ehh?
@keezyfiles sb bound
Too tough - Williams, Yaz, Boggs, Ortiz, Evans. Totally personal after the first two. Nomar, Rice, Clemens, Eck, Tiant, Fisk, it never ends.
@alec_schreck
@Eagles I like it, but I don't understand it.
Why aren't you on the @Eagles yet big man? Let's make it happen!

@Sean_Marks
Who tf is this fool?!?
So we just snatched ours up for camp... any more questions?
Yes he's 1-5 as a starter but granted he's not a starter. If need be, id rather see him than any one else as our third guy
Fuck yes!!!!!

LMFAO!!!!!!! Good fucking luck
I like the move he was good at PSU, he had a so so o line & 1 O weapon & a good RB. His last season at PSU he had 24 TDs 9 Ints, not too bad
pure anger over that. You call yourself the gold standard team and then let one of your greatest just walk when he can still play? FOH!!
How do you break it to someone that they have to live in Philly? I feel bad for Matt McGloin. But hey, at least it's not Gary, Indiana
Hard worker and a Hustler. Gonna miss him
QB controversy?
Nice pick up. Good QB.
Forget Matt McGloin. We need to sign @RSherman_25 .
That whole situation as well as Dawks was messed up.
Good luck my friend!
I was crushed. Had his away jersey already, I bought his home jersey literally weeks beforehand. I didn't wear it until he came back.
Not really; they made it through last season with only Wentz and McDaniels
Agreed @Eagles https:// twitter.com/Fly_Malcolm_X/ status/851219526322704384 …
Can't be not can be. Top 4 seems clear but after that it's murky IMO...
Reggie Dawk Eric Allen Westbrook The Axe Man That's my top 5 list
Buddy of mine is Papale's cousin--he's a Papale, too. FAF #Invincible #VincePapale #FlyEaglesFly
That can be too tough a list. Teddy Ballgame is clearly . Yaz, Ortiz, Nomar...5th guy tho. Rice, Pedroia, Clemens, Manny, Idk...

Between Bednarik and Bdawk for greatest Eagle ever. I lean Dawk because I watched him live, but I can't discount what Bednarik did for team.
@blyons1982
AGREE
I'm curious what's your list of Greatest Eagles? I got Dawkins, Bednarik, Bergey, Westbrook..fifth spot is tough. Runyan,White,Joyner,Jaws
So @Eagles have Wentz, Foles and McGloin at QB http://www. philly.com/philly/blogs/s ports/eagles/Philadelphia-Eagles-Matt-McGloin-Oakland-Raiders-Penn-State-quarterback.html …
Since the announcement, there has been 1 mcgloin jersey sold to anonymous buyer
Whomstve
We don't need a backup Quarterback
Can't argue with that one bit.
That could absolutely be true.
A+ pickup
If I can make one distinction, Greatest Eagle all time vs. Eagles greatest player could be & probably are two different players.
I got a feeling @Eagles going to be Really Good
We needed a third string anyway lol
He didn't give up the protest, he just stopped kneeling, his whole movement is the protest
Yeah and he quickly gave up his protest the minute he hit the free market lol.

Matt Mcgloin!!! PSU BAYBAY! QB depth #FlyEaglesFly @Eagles #howieisagod
ima raider HELL FUCK NO.. THX FOR TAKING OUR GARBAGE OUT
Kaep showed this season that he has morals and money isn't a big thing to him
I don't know, he didn't deserve that contract anyways, and I doubt he thought he was worth it too. Probably wanted to go to an actual team
Be ready to not get much specially if you need it in the playoffs
McGloin will not make it out of camp
Why would Collin opt out of 17mil a year to take not even close to half of that in open market?
2 years 11 mill is not a ton for a backup like Foles. What do you think a proven backup cost
Random source for both tho so...
TBH I can still weep over his Jerome Brown speech. #GentleGiant #RIPReggieWhite #FlyEaglesFly
A random source is always the best for info
Moxie? You should pray that he never touches the field
Thank god , good luck @Eagles https:// twitter.com/nfl/status/851 473641850232832 …

You can't be serious. He Can't play QB in the NFL

@Eagles just signed Carson Wentz from @RAIDERS to a one year deal pic.twitter.com/oKQgKep437
Same. Easily my favorite
they spent a ton for chase last year, and this year they spent a ton on foles. they must have a lot of confidence in their 2nd strings
McBum
That same website I think reported later that it was fake
They were all in when they traded those picks.
YES, and a compassionate, moral man. My favorite @Eagles of all time. I miss him. #RIPReggieWhite #FlyEaglesFly

You going to need a backup who can actually play
Good luck Matt-- thanks for all the years playing for the #Raiders ...
He's asking for 10mil this guy asked for probably vet minimum
NFL Bum
Hopefully the @eagles draft reuben foster
McGloin is horrible you can't be serious
Good he's terrible
Next Tom Brady don't @
What kind of shit is this !?
But Kaep can't get a call
Good news is now all the rumors about the Eagles drafting a QB are done. Signing Matt shoes they're dedicated to Wentz long term #GoEagles

Last time foles played for the eagles, vick got hurt, he got hurt and then we were left with barkley. We need depth for the foles curse
#JoePaKnew
@Eagles why?
No need to waste a draft pick on a guy that has no NFL experience and most likely won't will we need him. Good pick up
@RobTitoMoore
The @Eagles getting some more #moxie
if your gonna overpay for all your 2nd string qbs, then why get a third?

You can draft backup QBs you know!!!!!!!!!!!!! @Eagles
alright now you're taking it too far
this seems pointless to me, any fans tryna enlighten me on this signing?
Why?? Why not get a qb rookie after the draft
I'd rather bring in a rookie for a third string QB
Well looks like I gotta root for wentz to tear an ACL.
