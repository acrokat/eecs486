And mission
Why is man capitalized
You guys came on too strong and scared @LAChargersFan99 no he's gone

Yuk!
Ryan Leaf - @Chargers biggest draft bust!
These reasons along with grooming Watson under Rivers is why I think this is the way to go at 7. Face of the franchise for next 10-15 years
Cala pero es la neta @Chargers https:// twitter.com/Chargers/statu s/851550203819638784 …
Mahomes is risky because of some of the decisions he makes. I am not a Webb fan. Big arm but sluggish feet, wildly inconsistent.
I've seen your tweets about Watson and I agree
I've been saying for months I thought Watson would be #1 QB off the board b/c of big game pedigree. He's a winner.
Fun fact #1) if his college D.C. Hadn't been an unqualified dolt, he would have been drafted top 10
Stunning
Interesting that I'm the only one who can see the possibilities in Peppers. Watson I can see going in the top 10. Groom the future
I like trub Mahomes and Webb
Get your DVRs ready! #NFL announced Los Angeles #Rams vs Los Angeles #Chargers Pre-Season Game on Sat, August 26, 2017. @Chargers @RamsNFL
If Watson velocity was 54 or better I'd be ok with it. His was 49 one of the worst ever recorded
Peppers is too risky I'd rather that pick be lattimore , Watson I really can't see him going this high.
You got muted a long time ago man, sorry
Meant so much to #losangeles when he broke this record at home! We have such great history in #la ! We would never bail on our fans! #boltup
lol
Facts
which is one step closer to real football
I double checked this and it was fabricated. I showed this to the NFL and they will promptly be removing 1st and 2nd round drafts from Rams.
not til he gets that record
Wowwww. ...He can't take the heat..A charger fanin Iowa, that knows NOTHIN
Sad to say gates has to retire for him to be more productive
@Chargers must go with #peppers . He Can run the ball, play LB and S. They love gadget players
He led all NFL tight ends in touchdowns last season. Now learn a bit more about @Hunter_Henry84 off the field: http://www. chargers.com/news/2017/04/1 1/five-fun-facts-about-hunter-henry … pic.twitter.com/q8qbZsL9zj

You dont care about shit. You wont go to one game.
Why can't all sports owners be like this? @Montreal_Expos @RAIDERS @Chargers
No, I have no interest in taking a punt returner with no defensive position in the top ten. Too much guess work/uncertainty.
@Eric_Ferraro of course dak and zeke 1&2
Not a fan huh?
Agree with blah
Only if they draft a developmental QB
And by the way, Peppers at 7...
I think they're more likely to play it safe and take a developmental day 3 QB, if at all. Peterman, Dobbs (blah) come to mind.
Not sure Watson would be the draw, I think Bosa will be the face by the time they get to Inglewood.
Watson would be the draw in LA not Rivers
That's how I see it
If by chance they do pick Watson, I predict he will only sit for 2 years.
That first round pick has to contribute right away. Doesn't make sense to draft replacement now unless they think 17 won't be here in 19.
I believe in planning for the future, I just don't believe in having a first round pick sit for three years on team w/ 9 wins in 2 years.
So what you're saying is 0-2 and a intimate setting of Seahawks and Saints fans. You don't fight for us why should we fight for you? #Loser
I guess you can say both, and yes I can believe they could take Watson. Unlike most fans I believe in planning for the future
So that's top five who you want them to take more than who you think they'll take. You can't believe they'll take Watson.
@Chargersmoose @Lightning_Round My 5 choices who I think the @Chargers will select at 7. Hooker Adams Watson Davis Peppers

go back to san diego. we dont want u
That would be cool!

They should rebrand before it's too late.
I'm in that pic! But behind everyone. Lol.
It really doesn't matter where chargers play. They do not have a large fan base period.
You're a #Dolts sympathizer, what do you know about the rich tradition of LA #Rams football?!
Not a fight at all when nobody in LA even gives 2 's about #Dolts or there fight for Attention.....
Just embarrassing how they market. They'd be smart to quit pretending it's a #FightForLa . It's so disingenuous. It's really a #Fightfor $.

Rams fans took over the Q in SD. Y'all will never have a good fan base in LA
Fight for LA? You gonna take blame for all the brawls amongst @RamsNFL & Bolts fans at @lacoliseum game? #neednewmarketingslogan
They need to step up...
when your team downgrades by leaving a perfectly good stadium to move into a soccer venue #FightForSD
Bootleg manufactured rivalry, meanwhile the real one vs Oakland derailed for skrilla.
Here's an idea bozo's. Give away 4 free tickets to each game in Stub Hub. 1 set in SD 1 set in LA. Try harder drink water you look thirsty.
This bores me.....yawn....whatever you want it to mean.

Grew up in SD live in LA, loved exciting driving to SD for a game season ticket holder. New stadium is 5 miles my home. SD fans you suck
Go back to San Diego @Chargers
I hope so!
We will beat Raiders regardles. Chatalkinbout!
Chargers will always the San Diego chargers! This year will be the sadest season even if we have a great season, LA is home. SD you loose
I think we beat them in LA but a close lose as of now. If we grab some pieces we could in the draft and go 12-4
Can not wait for the season to start loyal Charger fan for 40+ years. Ready to support and cheer as a season ticket holder... #boltcity
Ready to break into the new chapter with my BOLTS
I'm rooting for the bird poop. Thanks for offering a better alternative to #DeanSpanos and the @Chargers org.

What did the Chargers do in the offseason besides cut players? Look what the Rams did. Rams are a better team than your slapdick 3-13 team.
It's nothing else new I need lol that's all you need to know my guy that's going stick with the your team until they win a Super bowl
Sell the Strength Speed and Development shirts please @Chargers https:// twitter.com/chargers/statu s/850080815769833472 …
Cool?
I'll be able to watch it, it might not be on TV but I'll watch it.
lmaooooooooo. ..Yup...He'll catch it on tha radio...And won't even watch him play the entire season
Who cares?
Fans? What Fans? Your owner walked out on his fan base. The team was publicly booed at the Clippers game. Fans? Geez
Your team sucks, they won't make the playoffs this year.
Great way 2 get used to playing in front of 30k fans, especially when you move into 70k seat stadium & still have only 30K fans show up
How? I'm a @Chargers fan and loving this! Better than the Rams thats for sure! #FightForLa
Yea... I know that what?.... 2 month ago? Please tell me something new.
Let's go @Chargers ! What makes football special are the fans that share your best moments w/ you & love you at your worst. right here SD
Your team blew 28-3 lead with 12:33 left in the 4th quarter
that last one is so weird to see.
Sucks to be a Chargers fan.
The 2 teams who dumped their fans on TV against each other. Hope you both go 0-16
#Chargers run LA
2-2.
I'm not mad that the @Chargers left, I'm just mad that the first @Seahawks game is at Chargers but it's no longer here #justmyluck

Tickets were going for 6 bucks last few games. Stubhub was flooded with Rams tickets people were practically giving them away.
I have friends that are Rams season ticket holders the fans bailed on them. Dont be in denial.
Yeah with the @Chargers https:// twitter.com/josh_gordonxii /status/851497884377899011 …
@Chargers should draft it see if they can stop anyone.
Yes, that too. But they are team fans. I do take that into consideration though. Good point.
Yes! That too! Scotland, England, Japan, Brazil, Canada and Mexico!
Unless they had no past San Diego connection, I have to wonder if they're simply folks who felt they couldn't afford to live in SD anymore.
Also from other countries, i'm in Glasgow Scotland Brian .

Could care less
That's more like it!
I'd venture to guess anyone that enjoys professional football, for starters.
I know that's 3 pretty solid 3 players. Peppers got the speed but don't have range darn
I'd be okay if that became reality!
Change subject. I dreamt that the Chargers traded down with the Colts and picked up Barnett 1st and picked Peppers and Cam Robinson 2nd rd!

@JSi5 #17 I wonder who's jersey number that is @Chargers @RealPhilRivers
Dak over Zeke...????????????????? First ROY and now this??? I'm gonna be sick and how is Dak 1!!!!
Dak outplayed Rodgers and Elliot did his usual at 21 years old run for 125 yards in the playoffs
But they certainly showed up
Agreed but everyone ahead of him, haven't won a playoff game either.
On October 27, 1974 the @Chiefs and head coach Hank Stram defeated the @Chargers 24 to 14. KC was 3-4 for the season.
Evans>>OBj
Perfect List!!
Gotta show up in the playoff games when it counts OBJ was a joke that gm against the Packers terrible defense
I like hill he's a great player but he still dosnt have my respect yet just like vick
Yes she was.What he did is indefensible, but that's in the past he's said and done all the right things to show he's a different person now.

There's always a 2nd chance for someone

Well it seems that LA doesn't really care where it came from, they just kind of take what they want. THEY COMING FOR YOU N**** pic.twitter.com/D8eFQuxXgp

The Kings already have that song locked down.....so yeah probably.
You DO realize when they started they were the Los,Angeles Super Chargers, right? San Diego took them from LA. That's a Fact. Get over it.
Hell yeah it was! Good game
Is this the song the @Chargers will come out to this year @ImDrakeSmith #Chargers #LA pic.twitter.com/GnFYxCizt6
LABolts!
Man I'm watching NFL red zone @Raiders v.s @Chargers damn the http:// O.co was rocking that day.
(Fight For LA) Looks like ur fighting for a purpose sry the truth hurts
1. Landon Collins 2. OBJ 3. Jameis Winston 4. Marcus Mariota 5. Dak Prescott
That will be the @chargers in Inglewood.
Consider the source
1 is pushing it. 3? Not yet.
Glad to see all 12 of them came out
LT is not and never will be a "LA Charger"... GFY Spanos
Zeke above Dak
Representn all points on the compass in SoCal n beyond. Way 2 go the extra mile🖒 #DHBC #BoltUp #BoltFamily Beyond City borders Chargers Fans
Does it not say UNDER 25?
Amazing how 1 year behind the worst Oline ever assembled along with a garbage QB & not 1 good WR has taken @TG3II off this list #FireSnead
Should be 1 OBJ 2 Zeke 3 Mariota 4 Evans 5 Winston
Anaheim was in bankruptcy and she had a golden opportunity to develop a retail/stadium complex but took the free money & stadium. Next.
Its not
Hes not
Lmao Skip is so delusional holy shit
this list better not be in order
@ProFootballHOF @Chargers @LT_21 Agreed. Lo'Neal lead the way to canton.
Saw that coming
Pretty sure LA is Raiders country
the former @Bengals FB, Lorenzo Neal will be enshrining LT into the HOF - that guy was a beast!
pic.twitter.com/cDQocsGR9S
Could be 1
I like where your head is but zeke should be two just because it is his First year next year with the same or close to sand number he
wow, like almost 30 people. Quite impressive. Makes tailgating at the Q lame by comparision. Fight for LA deano
I hope @stephenasmith sees your top 5 Skip. #YoureCrazy Odell>Dak
That's ridiculous it's only 1 season Skip
How can you take Skip seriously? Such a homer? Sorry OBJ is better then Dak, Elliot.
Winston is better than mariota right, but otherwise, yes.
And their reasoning is a murky as the Mighty Mississippi.
You must be asking for charger fans right? pic.twitter.com/WK1WCcAigP
Bosa? Really?
DJ has to be in this group!!
@RAIDERS aren't doing new logo. @Chargers are a lost franchise they will. I love new #LasVegasRaiders stadium. https:// m.youtube.com/watch?feature= youtu.be&v=BbOiOP4zD5s …
Vic Beasley
We went 1-19 without Romo before Dak dawg. You don't know what you're talking about
Lol
Ok well that has been settled and I'm just strictly talking about him as a football player. He's one of the best up and comers...fact
Facts! pic.twitter.com/VzflfKJFjW
Hey, How many retweets for a Signed Phillip Rivers Jersey?
Zeke should have won it
Both QBs here are overrated. Good, but not to Elliott/Beckham level
It has to do with a river in Egypt: De Nile.
"Empty." pic.twitter.com/Kl7OOqqoYM
yes, bosa is the best pass rushing rookie of the era mariota is off and on, still better than dak though
He's a top 5 rb of all time, of course he's going to be in. Woodson will get in too don't worry
Notice no answer. Typical Stl reply.
All you haters need to get over it already! We aren't actors! We are DieHards 4 life! Either be loyal to your team or don't! #IRanForLA
Billy, why do Stl ppl think SK moved for money but GF moved for, uhhhhhhh, something other than money. Denial? Stupidity? I don't know.
No because we can't say Mark has better stats. Mariota has better stats and beat his ass so how is he not better at this point?
pic.twitter.com/Ep6OuRPkIx
Where they they at the games? Coliseum was empty
Meant it more as a joke...it would be a huge mistake to rebrand an organization as iconic as the Raiders. Don't see why the Chargers did it.
Salty-eggans can cry and whine all they want. WE HAVE THE TEAM IN LA NOW who's laughing now dickheads.
That's the same as saying when you're out on a date .. are you a paid hooker?? Just cuz u look like one doesn't mean you are right?
You of all people should know LT deserves it, he destroyed your defense for 8 straight years. Arguably a top 10 RB.
You do sore loser
Like they did in San Diego.. or how SALTYEGGO failed them? Hahaha sucka. Go back to your mamas couch.
It's not San Diego is it.. buahahahaa
Los Angeles.

Did you turn Hef into a @Chargers fan? #BoltUp
He beat him once out of one. Smoked his ass to be exact. With a shitty line no runnin game and no receivers. Mariota>Winston easily.
Dosnt change the fact he still hit her
Agreed!
My question is why Dak over Mariota?
Wentz didn't even make the playoffs dude c'mon now
Being left out because of Skip's Dallas Bias
Only makes sense, he always lead the way! #thisisboltcountry
Defensive rookie of the year and 10 sacks in only 12 games is something.
New logo?
Fraud Fraud Fraud
couldn't pick anyone better
Fresh new start! Like when you abandon your home and get a new spot next door for free! #boltup #fistforla
No news about the @RAIDERS looking to the @Chargers logo designer for help on emblem. #RaiderNation #LasVegasRaiders http:// us.blastingnews.com/sports/2017/03 /oakland-raiders-are-bound-for-las-vegas-001582329.html …
people say Tom Brady is the product of a system......
Danielle Hunter > Joey Bosa. Do your research...
Everyone in #la has an LT jersey for when he broke the rushing record or when we handed them out for free. Meant so much to the city #boltup
This hurts my heart @Chargers . Nothing new. #Chargers pic.twitter.com/tP09qK6ZCh
He's trash.
Really? Dak = 23 TD 4 INT, Winston 28 TD , 18 INT. 18 fucking interception You're lying to yourself .
He and Kurt Warner shouldn't be in over alot of the greats who are yet to be enshrined
Did he say San Diego Chargers? That's our old name from 4 months ago. We play at Stubhub now and are the #losangeles Chargers of free venues
Most biased list ever by a shitty person
FIGHTFORLA
Awww quit crying. He had one of the all time great rookie seasons. You just mad. And I love it.
pic.twitter.com/tvODUKtqiz
You kinda have a point but what exactly are you tryna say tho?
Odell should be higher
You drunk? Bosa is a beast.
Congrats bro
I'm saying it goes Odell then everyone else it's not close u just don't know enough about football to understand that though
Who won rookie of the year?
lol @chargers fans realize winning isn't everything. Neither is loyalty. It's about money and PSLs. #boltup
Holy hell that's like 14 people!! We only had 6 at the hotdog event! We so #la baby! Football is family and money is everything! #boltup
@undisputed @dallascowboys @dak @Jaboowins @jbbigbear @Chargers this how you kno @RealSkipBayless stupid, where @L_Bell26
1dak 2zeke 3bosa 4mariota 5 Winston 6 obj
Not bias at all
1. Odell 2. Zeke 3. Winston 4. Mariota 5. Bosa Dak is not top 5
The @Chargers D really stuffed me in M13. Good job, whoever the defensive coaches and coordinator are. Can't do a thing with my bruisingback
Odell being under Dak is a joke...Dak being number 1 is a joke...all these players on this list and more are better than Dak
bosa is a beast lol
Its Skip Bayless, you cant reason with him
They letting anybody in the hall these days
GREAT CHOICE! LoNeal was greatly responsible for LT's success and LT has always given him credit - they go into the hall together <3
Perfect choice.
Wrong
Gotta switch bosa and odb for bosa only being a second year player
@LorenzoNeal leading the way for LT to hit the ultimate NFL paydirt the HOF
bosa was a beast
She forgave him and they're still together... cast the 1st stone dude
There's no QB system in Dallas. He's just good and idk why people can't see that in him
Oh you mean the same system that turned Brandon Weedon, Matt Cassleback, and Mark Sanchez into Franchise QBs? Learn before you speak
Mike Evans says hi
It's like the @chargers refusing to wear powder blue even though the fans want it, I don't understand
@realronalddarby >>>>>>>

Really? Pfft
How bout Danielle hunter 12.5 sacks
1 Zeke 2 OBJ 3 Mariota 4 Bosa 5 Mike Evans
Funny, where did these fans go during the end of the Rams first season at the stadium? Lukewarm ass fans, fair weather.
There is not fight for LA. We all know Rams own LA.
We've only seen Jameis and Marcus one time in the pros we all know what happened.
Shut up. Jameis is not as good as Mariota. Go compare stats then come talk to me.
Typical Deano move. He hides behind the curtain. Not much of a fight 4 LA. He got his money and he could care less about any fans. #fakenews
Welcome @Chargers http://www. chargers.com / So excited for your first season here!
Winston =
Last time I check @L_Bell26 is 25 but I could be wrong
It's actually Dak Overrated.

@RealSkipBayless is a homer and can't see past his cowgirls!! I can't wait for the sophomore slump for these two guys!!
Dak plays way more technically sound. Wentz doesn't even have correct throwing mechanics. He makes rash decisions like throwin into dbl co.
Winston? Really. #3 at that
He must be the most biased host on TV for any sport I've ever seen, and because of that you can't take a word he says seriously
Your biased perspective, nullifies this list!

OBJ should be 1
Jameis over Odell! Pfft
wintz? What's gonna be the excuse when he sucks with Jeffrey
If Dak didn't have Zeke is he still in your top 20 even? No
Landon Collins?!?! @RealSkipBayless
Idiot
Dak maybe. Jameis no
Lmao Dak and Jamies over Mariota is a joke.
Respect. But imo Odell the best athlete and football player out of all
Tyreek hill better than them all
Joey Bosa had hall of fame-like production in his rookie year. Plus it's my list, I can rank them where I want
Lol this list Hollywood af
You still can't put bosa over Beckham idc . Odell had the most production out of all of them
Worst list ever??
No surprises​ here. Skip.. Skip...Skip.. I'm surprised that your list didn't include the a few more cowboys. You tried to look objective.
And GF left LA because???
I put the rooks ahead because they were already a top 3 player in their respective position and ONLY in their first year. That's why
I can hear odell crying
No way
Idiot
No, what's football?
I wouldn't put rookies in that list. League has a full year to adjust and you never know if someone is a one hit wonder
Ur smokin crack
Hell nah odell Winston mariota bosa dak/zeke u can't put rookies ahead of people that have had like 2-3 good years
How tf Odell not one dak and zeke aren't even close to this man they had one good year Odell has had like 3 this list is a joke
@NFLonFOX @dallascowboys @dak @EzekielElliott @Jaboowins @TBBuccaneers @Giants @jbbigbear @Chargers lol Dak 1?
Had to do better during playoffs
At least 3 or 2
Beckham 3 is that a joke skip bayless list
25...points?
pic.twitter.com/HBVxZdP8jM
pic.twitter.com/SE716YTeMT
1. Bosa 2. Beckham Jr. 3. Zeke 4. Winston 5. Dak
Do you watch football? Bosa is amazing
Let's go Buckeyes
Wentz > Dak. Dak is a product of the system. Wait until 17 when he's exposed
Such a homee
All have a checkered past
@ThrillrideInc @Jaboowins @jbbigbear @Chargers Joey Bosa??? Don't you have to actually do something to be on the list?
Winston?
Why isn't Odell #1?
Skip is a throat waiting for any Cowboy at any time.. undisputed
1.Zeke 2.Odell 3.Dak 4.Bosa 5.Winston
@haha_cd6 better
He's definitely high on something...
This is a complete Slop list!!!!!!! Hahaha the whole over rated Dak thing may be the biggest trash hand job fest ever
The fact that Odell is not number 1 is terrible
James Winston overrated !!!!
Skip made this list, right?
Unbiased
Umm where is Marcus mari a?
2 Cowboys at the top Shocking...

Except we aren't paid fans, just true life long fans. Get over it.

You guys are still paying these actors.... smdh
Chargers country?!?!? Lmao
I stood outside y'all training earlier this week while y'all were back in San Diego and i didn't get this kind of love. Still a fan tho. :(
YOU HAVE A NEGATIVE AMOUNT OF FANS

@Chargers UT's Derek Barnett reminds me a lot of Shawn Merriman
Chargers ownership is likely The most hated in the NFL. We despise ownership. This is nothing against the players
I'd be down with that.
Raider fans dont jump ship.
And there are no Charger fans in LA So give that thought up. Never going to happen. Have fun at the empty stadium in Inglewood
Not all, but some raider fans will switch.
And during LA 22 football absence, many people picked cool popular teams. Cowboys, Raiders and whoever won SB. LA now has NFL
I see raider fashion, yes. Not all are fans
Been in LA 50 years and yes LA is Raider Country. Look around all you see is Raider fans.
