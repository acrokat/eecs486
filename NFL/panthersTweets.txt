Don't even think about drafting a DT
Always and forever.....my team @Panthers pic.twitter.com/2uHPJRJzY7
But Kyle you are right idk what this dude is talking about he seems like a bandwagon fan that stayed after the 2015 season
Kyle I think that the Panthers should get Fournette for the sole reason of he's the best rb prospect since AP
Because it doesnt fit the Panthers system!!! Mccaffery is a Danny Woodhead type player, he can only rush like 15 times a game
I wish the @panthers would grab him at 8
I understand that but why get a one trick poney over a all around player
Nvm I'm not going to argue I'm done kinda pointless
That's great and all, but he doesn't fit Carolina's run scheme
As I said power isn't the only thing mccaffery is I'm saying he can do that mccaffery is a more all around player fournette is just power
Stewart is 30 years old meaning his best days are behind him but in a career, I'd say he "hit his numbers"...? I don't understand you
McCaffrey ran mostly outside the tackles. He ranked 2nd in that category. Indicating he's not a pure power runner...
Uh yea Christian can do that two d'Angelo Williams was a skilled player Jonathan Stewart still hasn't reach his numbers
Do you not know what "power scheme" means? It means you run through the tackles with power. Which is what Fournette does
¿Qué contratación es clave en el draft para que @Panthers vuelvan a ser protagonistas? #NFLxESPN
Lol
That's it strength
Fournette is a pure power runner which is exactly the scheme that Carolina runs. Like 70% of the time
Had a convo with that dude a few days ago. He doesn't understand that McCaffrey isn't a between the tackles back...
Rb cook
McCaffrey is good but no way we ditch the scheme just for him.
@Panthers when do you guys think single game tickets will go on sale?
Thank you for the and the dedication that you shared with the children there our future it's all about the quality time you spend.ThankYou
See @PrimeDorsey knows what's up. I dont even like the Panthers and ik the scheme
But he doesnt fit the panthers scheme and he put up like 9 reps on the press so he isnt strength. Panthers are a power running team...
Fournette is tougher. Even tho he's injury prone, he fits scheme
Hell no fournette I simply strength and breakaway speed mccaffery is strength skill moves speed break away speed and more
Not Christian that isnt a scheme fit. Maybe trade up for Fournette then Tabor in the 2nd and McMillan in the 3rd and Hansen in the 4th
Nice but we need Christian 1st round rb tj 2nd round lb maybe Desmond king 3rd round cb or Cameron Sutton 4th round cb Ryan Switzer 5th
Dear @steelers & @Panthers , PLEASE move your preseason game to Week 1 or 2, so fans can actually attend. PLEASE & thank you.
Definitely would soil myself if the @Panthers would hit him up in the 2nd.

Somebody ask me about my day!!! Amazing actress @TeaLeoni liked my tweet! Love @MadamSecretary plus she likes @CarPanthersNews @Panthers pic.twitter.com/XZ9qNG1mXA
@Panthers I sent you a DM guys :)
Maybe some running backs and wide receivers would be nice too
So the expectations aren't there with the @hornets like they are with the @Panthers #BuzzCity is excited if we just make the playoffs.
Never let her go bruh....and those shoes are comfortable as hell! lol
Unfortunately with how the NBA is structured the @hornets have no shot at winning it all. The @panthers have been to the door step at least.
Wish I could! But it's about a 2.5-3 hr one way drive for me…and I really love my 911 dispatching job. #KeepPounding #neverbeentoagame
this will never get old.

But couldbt we use another WR?
@Panthers this ole lady was checking out your home yesterday @fireup611 pic.twitter.com/Cn58NXBYsg
You can ABSOLUTELY have enough pass rushers omg. We have wasted so many resources on DL depth I'm going insane. Stop the madness
The Carolina @Panthers joined in the Twitter fun on at the @SuamicoElem Interest Fair. Check out the thread! https:// twitter.com/NSmithGT/statu s/850050324366860290 …
Can't wait! #KeepPounding
The defense will bounce back from last year, won't be like 2015, but it'll still be great. You got a MVP in Cam, take care of him first
You also need a run game to take pressure off of Cam. Stewart can still play a little despite being 30, but the 8th pick is for Fournette
You can never have enough pass rushers. Here are some names to know if the #Panthers take a DE in the first round. http:// panth.rs/Rs1rIg
Listen @Panthers idc who we cut go get @RSherman_25 please
I think that Sidney Jones injury gift wrapped him to my @Panthers in the 2nd round.
Happy Birthday man! #KeepPounding

Our offence needs more help. So on balance & if the choices are equal value, Offence. IF the right guy is there. The right guy is not a RB.

Fournette ain't coming in mccaffery is starting and we winning superbowls
And that's where Fournette comes in
Still we need a new overall skilled rb healthy Stewart will find his way to another injury
Team went 15-1 2 years ago with Stewart. Like chill, last year was filled with injuries.
Than with Stewart we won't go no where
Do you think he would be a productive power based LDE on run downs in a 4-3 who can shift inside to rush the passer? #KeepPounding @Panthers
Another day. Another pointless convo with another "twitter fan"
Bet. McCaffrey wouldn't even start!
Christian would be like here cam hand me the back td every time fournette hand me the ball stoped by talib
Simple with all the pressure on cam from people trying to knock his head of Stewart against a Seahawks defense last year or broncos
We don't get mccaffery we go 5-11
On why Carolina wouldn't have made the playoffs if everyone was healthy all year
If Fournette goes 4th, then Carolina will take Barnett. McCaffrey's value is not close to 8th. Huge reach
Hear what
He's gonna go 4th yes he has more TDs I'll give him that
I'd love to hear this one from you
Do you realize we wouldn't
Late
Raiders, Chiefs, Bucs 2x, Vikings, all were meltdowns late in the game.
You do realize that if the team stayed healthy, they would have easily gone 11-5?
Fournette scored 19 more TDs. There's a reason why Fournette is projected to go 4th or 8th.
Yes and even if their were no injuries with how other teams built up we wouldn't made playoffs
@panthers #Play60 https://www. instagram.com/p/BSlt9e1Fj3M/
The SB year was a healthy year, except for KB. But that forced Cam to make smart decisions with his passes
Christian started a little light than brought hell to the college league
You do realize last year was all about injuries, right? Everyone but Norwell missed time on the oline. Both rookie CBs got hurt

We were talking about the difference in their skills
So we don't have a 2016 repeat and get some ring we need a rb that can do everything not just be about strengh
I don't even understand what you're trying to say in this tweet.
Good rundown of #Panthers needs - NFL1000: Carolina @Panthers #NFLDraft2017 Preview via @BleacherReport http:// teamstre.am/2o4WjKU
If you're making a case because of the race, then look at Toby Gerhart, Peyton Hillis, and Tyler Gaffney. Not very good.
Exactly mccaffery is based on all strength and break away soles only mccaffery mix of skilled moves strength raw speed break away speed
Why wouldn't you want a running back that is big and strong?
Leonard's skill set includes major strength and breakaway speed
Stats 4x better? McCaffrey: 632 attempts 3922 yards 21 TDs. Fournette: 616 aatempts 3830 yards 40 TDs
Haha ion know bout that
Because he's white
People talk some much about fournette simply because he big strong and black people down and hate on mccaffery even tho he's the best rb
#KeepPounding
McCaffrey isn't as tough lmao.
You know where my heart at
And Christian can still run people down just as much as fournette
Stats 4x better more dynamic skilled rb best in combine Leonard is simply about strength Elliott mccaffery are about skill and more
Has @gbolles74 at 8 to @Panthers . Gross was a Utah stud that dominated tackle spot for carolina for years. Bolles up next?? https:// twitter.com/nfldraftscout/ status/850340495431794690 …
Tell me again how McCaffrey is better than Fournette, I'll wait
We have the opportunity to get the best rb in the draft why settle for a guy that's no where near Christians level?
Between him and Luuuuuuke @panthers fans would have league-best eye candy https:// twitter.com/NFL/status/850 362622990045186 …
Hell no why get fournette when we can have the best rb cowboys got Elliott soon as him and dark got together instant playoffs
Hell no im guessing we trying to have a 2016 repeat!
@ConnorJRogers do you see the @Panthers potentially getting @AdrianPeterson ? If so, how does that affect their draft & others #AVIDNYJFan
Lol. Fournette is coming home if he's there at 8. Best talent since AD. He's a power runner who fits Carolina's scheme

@RossTuckerNFL I'd rather the @Panthers draft Joe Mixon & give him a chance & direction than trading for Sherman.
They may not have a choice
Sure, before Richard Sherman was available they did.
And they like Bradberry as their number 1. There are too many reasons for this move not to happen
Don't forget that they'll have to trade a decent salary in the deal
Agreed. #AttackISISNotAssad
He's too expensive for Carolina. They don't have the cap space to trade for him
Wouldn't http:// happen.Cam is the biggest personality on that team & that's how he wants it.
Just dawned on me: The @Panthers should trade for Richard Sherman. Plugs the Norman hole, adds a veteran presence to the defense.

@Panthers don't draft cook nor Leonard Christian mccaffery all day best at combine stats 4x Leonard's
Mccaffery was the best in the combine
Mccaffery is better than both cook and fournette snatch mccaffery I hope we're not trying to have a 2016 repeat

O OK because I remember he had one against Arizona also

Seattle
Was that against Seattle or Arizona
@panthers the only reason you better trade up is to get that number 1 pick and get Myles garret! Stay put and be calm! @espn @NFL

LMAO ain't that right NO
we won't have the 8 spot . In fact we will trade up to get Leonard at the 2 or 3 spot

Taking a 3rd string DT last year wasn't terrible considering we were picking 31st. But taking a 2-3 year backup TE at 8 is a joke
That's the one I want next!
Everyone is on here saying no RB lol Fournette on the Panthers will not do what Elliot did for the Cowboys last year.
please no. Review list of TEs drafted in top 10 since '95 and see how those panned out, please and thank you.
So when Greg olsen is done lol cams gonna throw the ball to the kicker?? I suppose this kicker will also block when the O-line goes down?
That was a good game
Thank you @Panthers for being there for my great nephew & family after he was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma #pray4amiracle pic.twitter.com/Gpxy8IfZlX
