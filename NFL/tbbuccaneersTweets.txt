Well... Cook has been arrested a few times. And Fournette put himself ahead of team in deciding not to play in a bowl game...
Dalvin didn't skip a bowl game. He has heart

That's a photo of a wealthy man! Humiliated and man-handled. I hope he sues the shirts off of United.
Everyone notice 2 buckeyes go osu
He should be one tho where was victor cruz he didnt party and didnt do nothing o thats right he got a ring so he didnt care
Cause the yacht club in miami? Lmfao it was his day off he could of prepared more but he is young and immature
85% of passengers on airlines have no etiquitte dr is a prime example
think the "doctor" needed a bit of maturity-strange how a grown man could act that way-he is at fault
the so called dr is an embarassment to drs-he was at fault crazy man
Virgin has always been good
Right cause a horrible division sends the NFC Champion for the past two years to the Super Bowl right? Your logic is a little skewed.
WHO THE HELL IS THIS BOSA GUY SERIOUSLY NEVER HEARD OF HIM UNTIL THIS TWEET
If you are into humiliation & physical abuse, get you fix on United Airlines.
#GestapoAirlines
#GestapoAirlines
The last 2 NFC Super Bowl representatives were from the NFC South. Plus the QB play is stacked. 3 MVP's.
So do I. Too many good storylines and personalities to ignore. It's going to happen and the Buccaneers can handle it. #firethecannons
Hillary Clinton: "You can put @United Airlines into what I call the 'basket of deplorables.'"
Anyone remember the song "United Breaks Guitars"?this airline is very very bad. DO NOT TRUST THEM. https:// youtu.be/5YGc4zOqozo
Nothing BEATS the service at @United !!
May the odd be ever in your favor
Or the barbaric ground.
Nooooo!
@RSherman_25 come to @TBBuccaneers ..Were on the up. Need a shut down corner.. what'd ya say??
I was thinking the same thing. Tomorrows multi-millionaire is pictured right here.
NOT UNITED, NOT THEIR POLICE ..JUST POLICE. ALL OF SITUATION WASNT TAPED.BAD SITUATION ALL AROUND. MAN SHOULD NOT HAVE RESISTED EITHER
Law says up to $1,350. How much to fly their 4 employees 1st class on another airline? Less than attys & settlement of the lawsuit coming!
Sue the hell out of United Airlines--the "unfriendly Sky"
You're blaming Trump for this!? ... What next, tornadoes kill a minority, and he gets the blame? You're pathetic.
Personality sells hard knocks on HBO though, so I guess we'll be fine. Night bud
They have good players but not a good team
Didn't mean to offend anyone but it's true they are not a good team personalities doesn't win rings talent does and that they lack
The nfl south is horrible besides 1 team and it wasn't the bucs I could take a peewee team to 9 wins in that division sorry bro
I am. Winston, Evans, Desean, McCoy, VH3, and they could make the playoffs next season. So yes, serious
Come on r u serious
Last year we learned the the Rams did not know if the sun set in the East or the west! It was shameful!
It would be fun to see what really happens at one buc place!
How are the bucs shitty? They've got personalities on the team and they went 9-7 last year? Not a bad pick for NFL
Glad they keep picking shitty teams rams now bucs what a waste
i would not fly with @united after that i bet the guy sues @united
I will never ever again fly on a United flight I will have to change my Airline but that's okay I won't get beat up wanting to get home
I sure hope not. Don't need that distraction
We're on the brink of the playoffs, idk if I like the idea of a distraction like that
#WeAreTheBAY
The world awaits... well maybe not the world, but the bay faithful.
Winston might go for 5500 passing yards this season

Out of all bad decisions I have seen companies make this is one of the top 10 ever! I could guide UA better than current ceo
United CEO and leadership all need fired tomorrow. How a management team of such a large company can be so ignorant is unblievable

Lmao

Perfect!
FYI, the @UnitedAirlines twitter handle has been disabled and locked. It was active a few hours ago. Use @united instead. It is support

It is a stupid policy
Just like ISIS randomly chooses victims to execute
OF ALL PASSENGERS THEY PICK ASIAN COS THEY KNOW THEY CAN GET AWAY W/ IT. IMAGINE THEY DRAG A BLACK MAN OUT,UNITED WOULD BE IN BIGGER TROUBLE
Probably illegal or sleeper cell anyway
Smart move by @jasonrlicht & @TBBuccaneers Hopefully they do the same thing with Dougie too!
That's why I'm thinking standby. Jury is still out.
Gotta luv #the45ths racist america #BoycottUnitedAirlines
That's why I fly American most of the time. I'm not sure I've ever been on a United flight.
Very possible it could've been standby. Haven't heard any real details yet. Maybe this guy could claim discrimination . Y did they pick him?

The friendly sky's that volunteers you to leave the plane for their employees to fly then batter the person and calls them belligerent
Absolutely disgusting. This airline needs to be shut down!
This doctor had a patient waiting for him. He did not deserve to be treated like this. Damn you @united
CEO apologized for “having to reaccommodate these customers.” Really? Company's actions and their response inhumane. #volunteertoflydelta
Yeah!! Lawsuit!!!
When you have so much money and become so powerful and treat people like commodities it's time to show United who pays the bills. Boycott!!
F United
Right. Disgusting but not surprising anymore.
Looked crazy. First class, next flight, $500.00 voucher, I'm up. I'm betting now, this guy was flying standby.
I am sure that united escalated situation & there were multiple personnel there who probably didn't even understand y an assault occurred.
I'm sorry. I mispelled f*ck off.
Police were watching, but the person who assaulted the man looked almost like tarmac personnel.
Pay what?

Cops, TSA are more like Security Officers with no powers of arrest.
Wasn't United legging were American an never let them on. Free fliers because of family employee. Violated dress requirement. Pay attension.
This makes me so upset! That poor man I feel so sorry 4 him
The Browns game, get to see somewhat how the offense gonna look.
Those were TSA or cops.
He did... he bought his ticket arrived on time was seated then refused to give up his seat 4 a late arriving united employee! #assbeat
Not much choice down here, but there HAS to be more to the story.
as a skins fan , y'all gonna lovvvvee big swaggy . djax helps open other wrs up too . good luck this year i think the bucs are trending up
He should've went Bruce Lee, Jet Li or Jackie Chan on them! Fight or flight! No pun intended!!
I will never step on a United flt again!
Fly the Abusive skies!
Finally a Tampa vote! #FantasyFootball #NFL #TampaBayBuccaneers @TBBuccaneers https:// twitter.com/qalled/status/ 851526165785432064 …

@united must be run and managed by descendents of Heimrich Himmler. "Ze are killing passenger thriezig, ze are over booked..."
Jeb Bush like?
Why are my calls and emails not being returned about my tickets being revoked. Classless organization . 13 years down the drain. Live in NY
#BoycottUnitedAirlines
This is an outrage
Southwest it is
Fly Southwest. The correct way would have been to continue to offer a higher amount. Someone would have taken it. Outrageous!
I do when jameis comes to town
Lufthansa Great service, ground and air staff Good choice within Europe imho
fvck united
Can we please stop it with the pre-season hype? No one cares, and it makes us look bad to be going on and on about meaningless games
I hope he got his $100 voucher for giving up his seat
Disgraceful.
I need to try Lufthansa.
Browns and Redskins at home Weeks 3 and 4? Can we get Hurricane Hermine to come through and push the 'Skins game up a day again, too?
BOYCOTT UNITED NOW !!!!!!
#BoycottUnitedAirlines
Better let your friends know to use up their miles before United becomes divided.
Life a box of chocolates,,,,
Me either.
Air Canada here, there and everywhere w/Star Alliance airlines for local flights eg Munich Zurich w/Lufthansa. Not that I'm biased
None of whom will ever see another dime of my money.
Ha! Hopefully nice beaches, hot sun, and cold drinks. Cheers!
And remember...Target, Kellogg's, Nordstrom, et.al.
Ya never know where what journey life will take you on Dave. :-)
Well that's not what actually happened with the leggings... With free ride comes rules to be followed. Not the same situation.
My jetting days are behind me, but nonetheless this is useful info for many. And, re jetting days...who knows?
@TBBuccaneers please if we don't get cook or a TE. Let go akuze might of spell it wrong, but Col CB is the real deal
i have used @united in the past but never again.
Flying in Cda...westjet,,,Europe is Lufftansa,,,lots of leg room..

I don't fly Air Canada either. I use West Jet in Canada and Hawaii. British Airways overseas to London & Israel.
Get ready!!!
That you're never flying United again is awesome news. Hopefully my modicum of Air Canada stocks will increase in value?
Terrible mishandling! Just TERRIBLE! Rules of overbooking-- whoever gets in the seat FIRST, gets the seat! Right?
With you there one time flying is enough I'll drive.
It's good for the team. No doubt spence learned things from rolling with Joe Thomas
Sounds like the Jags is pretty much a done deal unless something changes
Yeah I'm cool with getting the Jags and Browns again. Hopefully we joint practice with both squads again. I'm really about that
Jags on the road is what it is, I like us playing them or the dolphins every year
Is the infamous TSA in action again..?
Weak. Who cares about the preseason?

I used to check Military Id,s s you came onto post
This poor man! Seeing cops' behavior at the airline's behest (obviously; they didn't send them in with a compensation check) is outrageous!
There are many great Law Enforcement Officers out there and most never have to draw their weapon or let alone shoot someone
Is that how people act in China? Throw temper tantrums?
Notta one. Awful we pay full price for that garbage
yes, but I don't think this was the case. Failed to comply, forcibly removed. No gun, taser, club, just dragged off.
Oh yeah.
Anyways I do support Law Enforcement Officers but there are a few bad apples out there not many.
think tha woman in the hiijab 2 rows up "Volunteered" him actually...
I take it your not a Military Veteran then other wise you would know what a MOS is
My Military job was Military Police nothing fancy about it I spent most of my time at the Gates
preseason is so low energy.
Ima wear a hijab to stay safe
Agree 100% and they should have!!
United could of put its Employees on another Air Lines and saved everyone the trouble.
MOS?
My MOS was 31-B I would tell United Airlines employees to do their own dirty work and I would walk myself off the plane.
Sure, very possible. Notice how everyone quick with their camera phones, but NO ONE quick to stand up and volunteer. Think about that.
Discusting!!! Buh bye United!
pic.twitter.com/pea9NiFEGv
Not all Police Officers would be willing to drag a man off the plane for not giving up his seat. I would tell them to choose another person
Makes you wonder about them having a random passenger generator.
Already added them to my boycott list. Over charge and over book then offer next to nothing. No takers call the cops.

Fly Alaska Airlines or Delta Airlines but never fly United Airlines unless your into S&M, free beatings on every flight.
Stop, or I'll say stop again! To what point should one go before using force?
put on leave until investigation is typical. He will be back as he did nothing wrong.
Terrible incident.
Boycott @united and sue @united until it bankrupted.
And a wrong way to do the job the Police Officer is not a credit to the men in blue.
Really the Police Officer was suspended after this, hopefully he will be fired for his actions, there is a right way to do this job.
As sick as I am of seeing the @Browns on the preseason schedule, the 3rd game usually has starters play longer.

Dak over Zeke...????????????????? First ROY and now this??? I'm gonna be sick and how is Dak 1!!!!
Wow very futuristic
Dak outplayed Rodgers and Elliot did his usual at 21 years old run for 125 yards in the playoffs
But they certainly showed up
Agreed but everyone ahead of him, haven't won a playoff game either.
Evans>>OBj
Perfect List!!
Gotta show up in the playoff games when it counts OBJ was a joke that gm against the Packers terrible defense
I like hill he's a great player but he still dosnt have my respect yet just like vick
What about the 3rd level!?
Yes she was.What he did is indefensible, but that's in the past he's said and done all the right things to show he's a different person now.
LOL Odell is easily the best
Carr?

We went 1-19 without Romo before Dak dawg. You don't know what you're talking about
Ok well that has been settled and I'm just strictly talking about him as a football player. He's one of the best up and comers...fact
Facts! pic.twitter.com/VzflfKJFjW
Zeke should have won it
Both QBs here are overrated. Good, but not to Elliott/Beckham level
The new host for #HardKnocks is reporteldy going to be the @TBBuccaneers . #NFL pic.twitter.com/u5z7HDSVhO
yes, bosa is the best pass rushing rookie of the era mariota is off and on, still better than dak though
No because we can't say Mark has better stats. Mariota has better stats and beat his ass so how is he not better at this point?
He beat him once out of one. Smoked his ass to be exact. With a shitty line no runnin game and no receivers. Mariota>Winston easily.
One Sunday Closer! pic.twitter.com/QxOFjytx2M
Dosnt change the fact he still hit her
Agreed!
My question is why Dak over Mariota?
Wentz didn't even make the playoffs dude c'mon now
Being left out because of Skip's Dallas Bias

Fraud Fraud Fraud
people say Tom Brady is the product of a system......
Danielle Hunter > Joey Bosa. Do your research...
He's trash.
Really? Dak = 23 TD 4 INT, Winston 28 TD , 18 INT. 18 fucking interception You're lying to yourself .
Most biased list ever by a shitty person
Awww quit crying. He had one of the all time great rookie seasons. You just mad. And I love it.
pic.twitter.com/tvODUKtqiz
Odell should be higher
I'm saying it goes Odell then everyone else it's not close u just don't know enough about football to understand that though
Who won rookie of the year?
1dak 2zeke 3bosa 4mariota 5 Winston 6 obj

Not bias at all
1. Odell 2. Zeke 3. Winston 4. Mariota 5. Bosa Dak is not top 5
Odell being under Dak is a joke...Dak being number 1 is a joke...all these players on this list and more are better than Dak
Its Skip Bayless, you cant reason with him
Damn I miss this logo. @TBBuccaneers any chance we bring him back with the current colors? Please!!!! https:// twitter.com/darrenrovell/s tatus/851056350998142976 …
Wrong
Gotta switch bosa and odb for bosa only being a second year player
bosa was a beast
She forgave him and they're still together... cast the 1st stone dude
There's no QB system in Dallas. He's just good and idk why people can't see that in him
Oh you mean the same system that turned Brandon Weedon, Matt Cassleback, and Mark Sanchez into Franchise QBs? Learn before you speak
Mike Evans says hi
I was desperately hoping the @TBBuccaneers would come to their senses and remember who they are and bring back the best uniform in history https:// twitter.com/darrenrovell/s tatus/851056350998142976 …
The change was appropriate at the time to switch, to change things up! Time for the @nfl to let the @TBBuccaneers have retro uni's again!
@realronalddarby >>>>>>>
every qb is a product of the system
The Titans would KILL yall
Should be 1. Obj 2. Bosa 3. Zeke 4. Mariota 5. Winston
Where's MariGoata

Is Vic Beasley over 25?
Less than three weeks away from the 2017 #NFLDraft ! Check out other key dates on the #NFL Calendar >> http:// bccn.rs/fFiR1r pic.twitter.com/n0Lno7ARLC
Really? Pfft
How bout Danielle hunter 12.5 sacks
1 Zeke 2 OBJ 3 Mariota 4 Bosa 5 Mike Evans
We've only seen Jameis and Marcus one time in the pros we all know what happened.
Shut up. Jameis is not as good as Mariota. Go compare stats then come talk to me.
a RB, but if theres another stud WR get him first.. then come back TE, RB and then S.
Winston =
Last time I check @L_Bell26 is 25 but I could be wrong
It's actually Dak Overrated.
*Dak
The only ones who love this list are cowboys fans
At beating woman
Idk probably at his house or something
Your on crack
How about vic beasley?
Bosa over Mariota?!
@RealSkipBayless is a homer and can't see past his cowgirls!! I can't wait for the sophomore slump for these two guys!!
Dak plays way more technically sound. Wentz doesn't even have correct throwing mechanics. He makes rash decisions like throwin into dbl co.
Winston? Really. #3 at that
He must be the most biased host on TV for any sport I've ever seen, and because of that you can't take a word he says seriously
Your biased perspective, nullifies this list!
@JoeBucsFan the nat media need to recognise the good QB does if they are gonna call out the bad - This was impressive. 3m run for charity
After 1 year obj is #1
OBJ should be 1
Jameis over Odell! Pfft
wintz? What's gonna be the excuse when he sucks with Jeffrey
If Dak didn't have Zeke is he still in your top 20 even? No
Landon Collins?!?! @RealSkipBayless
Idiot
Dak maybe. Jameis no
Lmao Dak and Jamies over Mariota is a joke.
Respect. But imo Odell the best athlete and football player out of all
Tyreek hill better than them all
Joey Bosa had hall of fame-like production in his rookie year. Plus it's my list, I can rank them where I want
Lol this list Hollywood af
You still can't put bosa over Beckham idc . Odell had the most production out of all of them
Worst list ever??
No surprises​ here. Skip.. Skip...Skip.. I'm surprised that your list didn't include the a few more cowboys. You tried to look objective.
I put the rooks ahead because they were already a top 3 player in their respective position and ONLY in their first year. That's why
I can hear odell crying
No way
Idiot
I wouldn't put rookies in that list. League has a full year to adjust and you never know if someone is a one hit wonder
Ur smokin crack
Hell nah odell Winston mariota bosa dak/zeke u can't put rookies ahead of people that have had like 2-3 good years
How tf Odell not one dak and zeke aren't even close to this man they had one good year Odell has had like 3 this list is a joke
@NFLonFOX @dallascowboys @dak @EzekielElliott @Jaboowins @TBBuccaneers @Giants @jbbigbear @Chargers lol Dak 1?
Had to do better during playoffs
At least 3 or 2
Beckham 3 is that a joke skip bayless list
25...points?
pic.twitter.com/HBVxZdP8jM
pic.twitter.com/SE716YTeMT
1. Bosa 2. Beckham Jr. 3. Zeke 4. Winston 5. Dak
Let's go Buckeyes
Wentz > Dak. Dak is a product of the system. Wait until 17 when he's exposed
Such a homee
All have a checkered past
Winston?
Why isn't Odell #1?
Skip is a throat waiting for any Cowboy at any time.. undisputed
1.Zeke 2.Odell 3.Dak 4.Bosa 5.Winston
@haha_cd6 better
He's definitely high on something...
This is a complete Slop list!!!!!!! Hahaha the whole over rated Dak thing may be the biggest trash hand job fest ever
The fact that Odell is not number 1 is terrible
James Winston overrated !!!!
Skip made this list, right?
Unbiased
Umm where is Marcus mari a?
2 Cowboys at the top Shocking...
@TBBuccaneers please don't draft Nixon, so many other talented, hard working, upstanding players. Ethical behavior matters to fans!

Question should be why tf would we draft a TE and not a safety like Jabrill or an olinemen?
Both are great fits. OJ is worth trading up for. Njoku if OJ is gone
questionable.. GO BUCS
Neither. Take Dalvin. Both these guys are overrated workout warriors

Prolly trade him. Has value now
mike alstott position change
wat happened to brate? Im good with him
Dalvin Cook
Njoku trash tbh
The question really is... trade up for Howard or stay put for Njoku?
O.J. Howard by FAR!
Why do people continue to think Howard will just be sitting there at 19? Foolish. Waste of time.
