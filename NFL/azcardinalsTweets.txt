Maybe the @AZCardinals can rename their stadium United Center where opponents will get punched in the mouth and dragged out before each game
Like to say thanks for this, but it is pretty bleak. Tom Tupa may have, overall, been the second best one on this list. That's sad.
Larry will you sign autographs before the game? Been a dream of mine to meet you!

@AZCardinals you should rename the stadium to honor Pat Tillman.

The @AZCardinals need to change the name of their stadium to Pat Tillman Stadium. That's the least this city can do
Seek help.
This is excellent! Do it @AZCardinals https:// twitter.com/bdenny29/statu s/851909757229080576 …
@BurnsAndGambo Weren't the @AZCardinals thinking about "Pink Taco" for the stadium name when this convo first came up in 06?
Pat Tillman Stadium has my vote
@Burnsy987 @BurnsAndGambo I love NFL and @AZCardinals , but @Suns always my Fave! They start winning again turns back to Suns town!

UofP deal was $154.5mil for 20 yrs. If we can get close to that figure, I'd bet Mr. Bidwill would be happy to put PT's name on the building
more like 18 though
We would need to crowdsource around $8mil/year to make this happen. Im in!
This needs to be a video montage
Logo is fire but they are going want that cold hard cash

I always thought the immortal Craig Kupp was a draft pick but no. But his son could be a diamond in rough out of E Wash this yr.
I guess I'm just happy he didn't have to include Kelly Stouffer
How about "University of Arizona North" field
Yes, it will support the troops.
Will this support a troops? Am I doing this right?
Holy hell. I had completely forgotten about Tony Sacca. On purpose. Thanks Darren....
As my good friend @daringantt likes to say, "I fear I've been typecast."
my pessimism precedes me.
You win the prize. I just told Kyle the comment was coming, and look at you -- right on top of it.

Seen the news that UoP Stadium is no more...wondering how much will it cost to name your stadium the 'British Birdgang Bowl' @AZCardinals ?
@AZCardinals should give the naming rights to the Pat Tillman foundation. Great gesture and a tax write off.
We would allow the @AZCardinals to rename it @AllCityTowingAZ Stadium and not charge them but a nominal fee.

I can understand, it's his home, but I'm sure he's a @AZCardinals at heart. It's alright, @Campbell93 ,.. you don't have to say it. lol
Should've went home and played for Denver

We could definitely raise some cash for charities- plus energize the fan base. There's already an established course by stadium...
definitely!! it was a ton of fun and brought out thousands of us...would totally work for you guys too!
He still not that good lol
yea I definitely agree, just not first round talent
Would be the future of the cards
I'm just saying he has crazy potential if he can sit behind a veteran for a couple seasons
Hes trash lol
he's a 2nd or 3rd rounder not 1st round material
Will be the top QB when all said and done!

I'm always a fan of best available player unless you're picking at the top and a player is by far the best at a position you need
Protection!! I mean look at Brady. They say he's got enough time in the pocket do to his taxes man! Lol then maybe a Qb later on. Not 1st.
I want to start a GoFundMe for @marquisbundy so I can buy him a new hat. @AZCardinals #gofundme #Cardinals #nfl

Only thing better than that is BA leads the @AZCardinals to the Super Bowl.

Well when the offense turns the ball over on their own 20 yard line that tends to happen
Well. How many?
Who gets that job?!
That somewhat depends on the draft.
That's where AP helps spread the field and they become more deadly on offense.
How about points. Some teams on the opposite side of the ball rack up yards between the 20s but can't get 7
Hmm, I thought he was looking for a Seahawk! "GO HAWKS!" LOL

Let's go @DavidJohnson31 make us proud
Mahomes would be a perfect fit for the @AZCardinals huge arm can sit behind Carson and get trained by the QB whisperer @BruceArians
Even the 2016 team statistic was well rounded, I believe allowed the least amount of yards per game
Should have drawn a Seahawk. @Seahawks
In which the @AZCardinals have had several good defenses that were tough to score on.

@AZCardinals 3rd round draft pick @WatchJRoss .......
Not to take anything from Fitz but remember that Rice played during a time DB's could grab
PHOTOS: Go @AZCardinals ! University of Phoenix Stadium holds Arizona Cardinals cheerleader auditions http:// bit.ly/2oTNtjr #abc15 pic.twitter.com/8QLO1XmtlZ
I know he's going to be targeted in the end zone a lot, but he only had 4 this year off the top of my head. I'm hoping for around 10+.
Wow. More similar than I thought! I think he will have another 1000 YD, 100 REC season, and I hope more TDs...
Who do you think is better at Social Media @azcardinals #atlanta_falcons ? Find out here: http://www. socialrivals.com/compare/azcard inals/atlanta_falcons … #socialrivals
I hear you. Go @AZCardinals !!!
#KNPTailgate Mock 6.0: 13 - Pat Mahomes, QB 45 - Christian McCaffrey, RB/WR 77 - Sidney Jones, CB 119 - Jalen Robinette, WR @AZCardinals
Rice 5.1 Rec per game, 75.6 yds, 0.7 TD. Fitz 5.6, 71.2, 0.5. But Fitz 101 games played behind Rice. Still 424 rec, 8506 yd, 83 TD behind.
I absolutely LOVE Palmer and Warner but they're not top 5 QBs.
I guess the only way could even figure out is if Fitz was willing to play longer. And I still could bring up QBs about that.
JR did play way longer and if Fitz were to to continue to play isn't he on pace to pass JR?
Rice top years still outpace Fitz top years.
Won't argue QB play. Montana and Young (and Gannon even) were excellent. But they were excellent in part because of Rice.
Maybe I'm being a little biased, but hear me out. Rice played longer than Fitz, and had more good QBs. Fitz has had 2.
well fitz dealt with bad qbs most of his career... rice had montana and young
Fitz is a great player. A Hall of Famer. But I don't know how you don't say Rice was the best.
Exactly! His stats are REALLY great as it is... If he had a Kurt/Carson his whole career his stats would be even BETTER.
only about 8,000, although if Fitz had a real QB throwing 2 him after Warner & before Carson who knows
Go Cardinals

Oh.
Tyler, how do you know nothing about wrestling? Were you the only 80s baby that didn't have a Stone Cold tshirt?
Tyler knows nothing about wrestling. It would be a disaster.
whew
Not gonna happen.
Haha. Well that's ok. Most podcasts have hosts with voices made for print.
I have a voice for print.
Ok I'm negotiating for Tyler. Derek, if he gets more retweets than you have followers, him and I will be guests on @thesteelcage
Absolute classy athlete, full of positive energy. I'm glad he's on our side
I am scared to ask, he is famous.
I think you can do better. Ask for more.
Like being nice to me maybe?
Haha I think if you get more retweets than Derek has followers, HE owes you something.
Well, they likely wont respond and Derek called me out. I had to make the number atleast as high as the followers he has.
Dude, from 5k to 50k? Lol you're negotiating against yourself. Could've moved to 15k.
Veldheer and dj getting new roles and healthy along with iupati and a pillar in shipley and a RG Johnson will set records
He's gonna be the best RB we were hurt at the o-line and he was a beast
Fine, 50K.
5K retweets? C'mon Tyler. Quit lowballin'.
@AZCardinals I'm just saying it would be crazy to have @RSherman_25 and @P2 on the same team #nobodywouldbesafe

I think it'll pan like marcus cannon from the patriots, there's not a lot of great RT's but jared has the skill set to be great there
Jared doesn't want to move but he will do what's best for the team, he's good at protecting the blind side but he will be good at RT

Younger not older @AZCardinals #beredseered
Can't find a player in league or in draft even half as good as Fitz.
@BurnsAndGambo @Burnsy987 @Gambo987 @AZCardinals should give up a 1st round pick for Richard Sherman! Haha

I think J.J. Nelson is close! Never going to be a full replacement but he's (IMO) our second best WR.
How you beat @AZCardinals ?
@AZCardinals I'm actually so in love with All or Nothing: a season with the Arizona Cardinals. It's actually so good.

My concern with not taking Mahomes at 13 is that none of the top QBs will be left at 45. @AZCardinals @Gambo987
My perfect draft in order would be QB, CB, WR, S, G, LB, DE, and RB if we keep all our picks and don't trade
I know the fans want mahomes but I heard we want kizer and that's why we have not been talking about him, he's similar to palmer
The jets and browns will probably take a QB, and if we don't take a QB houston, kansas city, or pittsburgh might take one of those guys
I think we take a QB first, the romo retirement affects a lot of teams with how they approach the draft
@AZCardinals give us Tony Romo https:// twitter.com/nfl/status/849 490569546092545 …
no build the o line.
Imagine having @P2 & @RSherman_25 on the @AZCardinals
@AZCardinals Trade someone for Sherman..
If he is the best player available
Anyone besides Narlon Hunpmhrey
Yes. Please don't draft a QB in first few rounds. #reaching . Be another waste of a pick
absolutely.
I'd say a CB, QB, or Safety.
I loved Aeneas, but Jake Plummer made them relevant in 98. Fitz and Warner brought them from the dead in 08. No real loser in this choice.
True, but in terms of impact vs draft position, Aeneas wins it hands down. BUT, Larry helped change the franchise, so, there is that.
#QuickSlant : Should the @AZCardinals take a CB at No. 13 overall? @PaulCalvisi and I discuss the pros and cons http:// bit.ly/2oCZIUx pic.twitter.com/V0WUXkjAvh
That wasn't a factor in their choices though. There are guys who were top 3 picks on this list.
Tough one, Larry was a high pick expected to be great. Aeneas was a small guy mid rounds.
I think @LarryFitzgerald should've been the @AZCardinals guy.
hmmmm! Either choice will be a good idea.
One guy who played in a superbowl isnt going to do sh*t. "superbowl winning" players are overrated, unless its a qb.

Class act
This is y the whole "staying in school 2get ur degree" thing is stupid to me. U can ALWAYS get ur degree IF u want it
. @AZCardinals legend Larry Fitzgerald made a promise to his mother that he'd go back and get his degree. He kept that promise. pic.twitter.com/CxIVU8DJGp
If the @AZCardinals get Kizer at 45. This will be a really good draft for them. I still think teams should wait till next year but https:// twitter.com/nfl/status/848 641258813784064 …
I think I have a slight addiction. @NewEraCap @AZCardinals pic.twitter.com/giJwnmBsyV
Yes. But is it high enuf for punts ? Dalls one is higher and it has been hit.
1x @packers & @AZCardinals DL (formally known as Dean Jonathan Muhtadi) @MojoRawleyWWE won at #WrestleMania w/ the help of @RobGronkowski pic.twitter.com/ltxyMbUFM2
The guy on the right has some pretty good memories..
Former @AZCardinals players have won half of the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royals.

To disappointment yea...
One football guy helps another. @MojoRawleyWWE by the way was once a @ddockett workout partner with @AZCardinals : http:// m.azcardinals.com/news-and-event s/article-1/Happy-To-Be-Here/d2070251-f484-4b5f-9e3d-4d2fb36a1bca … https:// twitter.com/wwe/status/848 664007812710401 …
To lose yet again to the Patriots?
Another Sunday closer... pic.twitter.com/4xOmh8gJgr
That's only half as impressive.
For the first straight year, a former @packers player won.

Sucks to suck
That's crazy.
Need that black cat to run across the field pregame like we had prior to @AtlantaFalcons game
......and Then 658 days later he threw 17 interceptions against the panthers on the NFC Championship Game
His replacement had his pro day Friday, would be cool if it were the case..
You got a cry baby reject from the Cincinnati Bengals. Not really something to be proud of.

Look at that baby face Carson Palmer lol. Glad the team traded for you Carson. #GoCards
And we are stuck with him forever now...
@TeamCoachBuzz What was the best piece of advice from this epic meeting?
On this day in 2013, we traded for Carson Palmer. Palmer also signed a new deal with us that day. pic.twitter.com/kMgMKiYM2D

Including a marriage proposal
I remembered. Just didn't have enough room.
@FinalFour @AZCardinals did not have a mother's room for nursing moms. Poor planning, guest services was zero help. @Alamodome take note
Not really a very good place for the Oregon Ducks tho.
2 memorable hoops games. 2 dramatic Super Bowls. Last 2 Nat Champ football decided by 8 total pts. Every @AZCardinals playoff game 1 score. https:// twitter.com/punchyjuan/sta tus/848402361240371200 …
@AZCardinals @Revis24 is still a free agent!!! Him and #21 at corner!!! Make it happen!
Season 1 of @allornothingtv was . The @AZCardinals were fun to watch. Huge fan of @BruceArians . Gonna be a tough act to follow, @RamsNFL .
"Is having" - FTFY
It might be isolated stands that aren't getting replenished in time, would be a huge screw up to not order enough. That almost never happens

Hahaha i know i did didn't i? Guess they didn't see Kent Somers tweet about it earlier, but i live for this
Hahahaha the stadium clapped back at you. You offended them

Food and beverages are being replenished at all concession stand locations throughout the day.
And run out of food, water, beer and other essentials
Hey @AZCardinals are concessions this bad at your games.
