Q. Daddy Daddy, what did you ever win ? A. Nothing kids, absolutely nada

@dallascowboys @dallasmavs @tonyromo 3rd guy from the right, 2nd row is looking away
love it
8. Le daba 9 si hubiera ganado SB y 10 si no existieran Brady Manning Marino Montana y Favre

Oh for sure
un 8 sólido
Hahaha
La más alta que le daría sería un 7

soy cowboy pero le doy un 8 falto solo la postemporada para llegar al 10
Un sólido 9. Siempre pensé que le faltó equipo para conseguir ganar un Super Bowl, hizo mucho con poco, en repetidas ocasiones.
5 puntos, buen jugador pero nunca llevó a su equipo al máximo nivel.

Tienes razón, desaprovecho la gran defensa que por años tuvo el equipo, el solo perdía partidos

Seria un 7.5 si no hubiese sido por jerry jones saboteando siempre a su propio equipo, hubiese tenido mejores numeros en playoffs

I think not
@AZCardinals vs. @dallascowboys

8en muchos años se cargó a un equipo sin talento
-6- Apenas aprobatorio, solo por sus números históricos de la franchisia, porque fuera de sus estadísticas, nunca supo ser ganador.
We're beating the @dallascowboys at @NRGParkFan this year! #CantWait @AshleyVilla8 @its_carlos69

6, no trascendió en los juegos importantes. Tuvo errores claves y cuando pudo, se lesionaba...

I'm not sure he can stay healthy enough to sit the bench ? Valid question ? Go Patriots
@dallascowboys give them whatever they looking for haha https:// twitter.com/bleacherreport /status/851895133910036483 …
That means that @swish41 will be our QB for one day when he retires?
@dallascowboys @dallasmavs @tonyromo Would be the ONLY reason I would ever go to a basketball game
Check the hat @BarstoolBigCat @PardonMyTake
I need a @dallascowboys decal sticker in my life.
I'll do both
Curious to why there are two #9 jerseys in this photo
You know those kids wear Dak jerseys on game day!!
@Warrenton21 @tonyromo @dicecrawford YOU STOOGES FORCED THIS MAN INTO RETIREMENT
You forgot #ad
Ridiculous. Aikman and Staubach didn't do this...and they brought Dallas multiple championships. #NoRomo #PublicityStunt
Jerry wants a "war daddy". I don't care if it's a "war turnip" or a "war chipmunk" as long as it can get to the QB. #Cowboys @dallascowboys
Always and forever, 9.
@MylesLGarrett You want me to get Jerry Jones a buzz so you can go to your @dallascowboys ? Hey, you did this to yourself man.
Does watching decal placement help with your #NFL withdrawals? You’re probably hungry #EatASNICKERS pic.twitter.com/cb0iegeei9

And he's intercepted.
I hate jerry too I think he's a bum. I just think romo is way under credited just because he didn't win a super bowl.
Going to the @dallasmavs game but I feel like I should wear @dallascowboys stuff... #Romo

Who's your team? Answer the question
They also didnt have a better defense and they didnt have Zeke, and also, Romo is better than Dak
And the patriots went 3-1 without brady this season

Love this!
Brady would be good most anywhere
If I were standing there I would be that short thing Tony has his hand on. Haha
"Stats are for losers." -Jerry Jones @NFL @dallascowboys
By the way who's your team???
Only reason we won a game was because DeSean Jackson fumbled on that pun return
I'm sure you're going to say "Dak is only good because of that like" while Matt Cassell, Brandon Weeden, Kellen Moore couldn't do anything
Because Matt Cassell went 11-5 with the Pats while he couldn't win a game in dallas with that same o line
And so you're saying Brady is a system qb???
@dallascowboys still the topic of discussion on ESPN. Get off our nuts bro
Anyone would be terrible in Philly
Why?

@tonyromo Can we start calling you Antonio now. Reporting live from espn deportes lol

Dak would be terrible in Philly for example
Nope..a system QB is someone who is only good in the system hes playing in, Peyton was the exact opposite for example
Inbefore torn a lot

Yes and for my @dallascowboys !

You're right. Kap is better than Romo and Rivers, because playoffs. Clearly. Nothing to do with defensive strength. Just QB skill.

Well, I guess Tony finally found a team that wants him. Fits him perfect, too, a team that can't win or get into the playoffs.
I love what they are doing with having him suit up, but I think it'd be even better for him to get a minute or two in garbage time
They're not even in the playoffs
I wonder how many of the @dallascowboys will be at @dallasmavs game tonight to see @tonyromo
Him at corner. Heath and Frazier rotate safety. Whitten at DT.

Wentz ain't on dak level n u know that but u gotta stick up for ya team
But in reality his worst playoff performances were for my Fantasy football teams, and was just meant as a friendly jab. no hate. #DemBoys
Damn, Romo looks terrible
nah, they are flip FLOPS I'm surprised you didn't get that

Never heard of a shoe named "Great performances overshadowed by team failures leading to a false narrative by dumb fans and media"
This really is a cool thing they're doing for Romo. It'll be a new trend.

I would love to see a game of #CaptionThis on this picture. So many possibilities, none of which look athletic.
Dak got the same amount of playoff wins as Wentz lmaooooo
Hey Tony, Were those shoes named after your playoff performances?
We not talking rings b. We talking ya trash qb n da goat dak, didn't know it was a crime to have a good o line. Tell gm to draft some once..
Damn I thought Romo was tall lol

I hope so
He's already got another job as a NFL analyst.
Hahah ok, good. Think Texans will draft one early? That team is ready for a SB run if they get a decent one.
Eli launches that joint and got 2 vs Pats and Brady got 5....DISRESPECTFUL to bring up Wack Prescott with them
@dallascowboys make this happen https:// twitter.com/josh_gordonxii /status/851497884377899011 …
I'm saying dak never under pressure n don't throw over 10 yards.. Can say that bout brady or eli..
Nah
@dallascowboys @JOSH_GORDONXII y'all should talk..... #comebackszn

I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http:// youtu.be/kdCFamJOX7s?a #FOXFaceoff - @dallascowboys owner Jerry Jones
so what category brady in then? he don't throw more then 10 yards n never under pressure..
Even with a broken back he'd be better than Tom Savage :)
awesome!!!

Can't wait for tonight! Great job @dallasmavs Where ya at @dallascowboys he gave y'all everything he had! Disappointing! #res9ect
We get to beat up on Seattle. Can't wait to play the Raiders!
Dak never under pressure and he don't pass over 10 yds lmaooooo
Hahah probably, I bet he feels a bit awkward but it will subside quickly
If Josh Gordon is available the @dallascowboys shud take a chance. Why not
It shouldn't be but even he kinda thinks it is too
I love it!!! What a great send off for a great QB.
After he blatantly quit on his team at the end of the season I would highly doubt they'd even consider it.
@nflnetwork @tonyromo @dallasmavs he turns the ball over. The announcer "and Romo throws another interception"

Not saying he couldn't win a championship, just questioning why he put championship down when he's never made it that far
He didn't accomplish anything
Seven years ago today... https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=Bv2Y8S Gp9aM&sns=tw … #RIP @dallascowboys
Kind of like rivers he's an amazing quarterback but in his big games someone has always went down with an injury
To win a championship you need two things skill and luck and he had the skill just no luck when it came to injuries to him and his team

To atleast a respectable record. I get no sb but we should honestly respect all the good qbs that are retiring. Might get stuck w mediocricy
carried it to what?
Everyone notice 2 buckeyes go osu
He should be one tho where was victor cruz he didnt party and didnt do nothing o thats right he got a ring so he didnt care
