@NFLTotalAccess @nyjets So the only teams that might be able to beat a better Patriots team than last year are the Raiders & Broncos in AFC.
@NFLTotalAccess @nyjets The Patriots have a system that works for them & they find players that fit the system. That's why they win.
@nyjets You did not listen about Jay Ajayi,Deion Jones, http:// D.Presscot.Now listen n draft P.Mahomes,Marcus Maye,John Johnson,Corn Elder

Lol, that's a great question. I don't think it was on purpose on our end at least.
Is it a coincidence that at one point or another all three of the players listed as "character concerns" played for the @nyjets ?
HUGE.
I'm sure she's a huge @SznDraft fan.....
correct. Assumption on my part is that both those dudes are still practice squad
yep.... Wilds?
hopefully she's there then
other practice squad RB named Brandon I think lol
He wishes...
is he the one dating Christina Milian?
lmao... Maybe Brandon Dixon will be there
also, are we next to Maccagnan this year? Or did you guys set us up at the Bradway Suite?

DO NOT TAKE A CB IN THE FIRST!! They don't impact the game enough.
I wouldn't accept Jets tickets even if they were free. I'd rather spend money on a college football game
The Day 2 gamble in the upcoming draft that could pay off in a huge way for the @NYJets ... http:// nydn.us/2nBqkFf pic.twitter.com/yBJ66LtrUp
Ha! Got rid of my upper tier season tickets. My condolences to anyone who paid for PSLs.
Unless if it's Tom Brady in round six, it's unlikely anything could make Mike Maccagnan look smart. We've seen too much already.
These games are one reason fans are giving up their tickets now; in addition, you can buy tickets on the secondary market for any Jets game.
It's not SNEAKY to take a player who is already injured or has an injury history, it's called STUPID! See Dee Milliner if you don't agree.
NO FARGIN WAY DO YOU TOUCH LATTIMORE'S HAMSTRING TROUBLES. SEE DEE MILLINER! Rather NYJ target fellow OSU CB Gareon Conley in rounds 2-3.
Can't wait to own one of these bad boys!
I'd love for the @nyjets to select Hooker (if they keep the pk) & get Jones in RD2. I'd be stoked if we traded back to get more picks
You are so pretty!
We miss the @NFL It's that simple Here's to the @nyjets doing what they do.. Go Airborne #Eu #NYC #Scotland #RedZone #TYMRookie pic.twitter.com/dVDmDcXJKf
What starters? TBA before kick off of Preseason game.
While paying full price for both practice games.
Always a fan, never a winner :(
Unstoppable!! Woot woot I love this prediction
AND WE HAVE TO PAY THE SAME PRICE AS A REGULAR SEASON GAME. IT STINKS DANISH
One of my favorite pictures!!! #LIStrong
No, thank you. We already drafted Milliner. Great way to keep the doctors rich.
@nyjets When do tickets go on sale for the preseason games? My trip from UK to NY manages to coincide with one of the games!!
I def should have gone that route
Any indications on what position they are looking for with their 1st round pick?
If McCown starts one game (other than if Hackenberg and Petty are hurt) then everyone in the organization should be fired.
. @garyvee who's gonna be the @nyjets QB this year? #TeamPetty
@MalikHooker24 @nyjets please
Worried about Lattimore being another Milliner. Like the idea of an under the radar Rd 2 pick at CB. Unless Jets trade down and get picks.
@nyjets @buffalobills @MiamiDolphins y'all ain't deserve the type shit the pats are gunna do to you I'm so sorry for your loss
@nflnetwork @gmfb @nyjets Christian McCaffrey would be ideal for the Jets if they got rid of Matt Forte. McCaffrey & Powell would be great!
i hope we sign Mangold to play RT

Just don't complain when Jet fans take shot at your line and OBJ doing something dumb. That is all
Don't be mad at me bc we stole your franchise QB #clutchGene
Preseason games are a scam by the teams (JETS) to squeeze money from the season ticket holders. The JETS also squeeze them for parking.

In a related story, they also get the Jets for 8 home games. That is the VERY short end of the stick.
Jet fans are use to getting the short end of the stick. The problem is when they try to ram it up their butts.
how can you tell the difference between Jets starters Jets backups?
that's a glass half empty way of looking at it tbh
. @NYJets season ticket holders getting short end of preseason stick this year. Games 1 & 4 at home. 2 games. Will see starters for 1 quarter

If Trubisky played two years with similar stats to this year, would he be consensus 1st pick? Where would he rank against recent prospects?
Watch Geno kill our defense in preseason
Fournette is available at 6th pick, yes or no? I say yes. Bad quarterbacks can still hand-off the ball
Could Hackenburg crack a high school roster at this point in his development? Does he know if he's righty or lefty?
Remember when you said the Jets would be in first place when Brady returned from his suspension? Unpack that for me...
Take a guess when, a year, five years, #NYJ will have one QB that they can rally around, and be a perennial playoff team...if ever!

In case you haven't heard - NYJ offense Awful!!!
Bryce petty
And whos the jets qb come on man its over preseason or not let me run the jets and youll see they should be better!!!
@nflnetwork @nyjets I think if Adrian Peterson is still available after the draft, the Jets should consider him depending upon salary.
Just seen it. 2 seperate locker rooms
That's what the offseason is all about 'hope' lmao
@NFL @BMarshall @Giants @nyjets we gonna beat the breaks of the jets met life is our stadium they just be renting it
True. Our dumpster isn't on fire...yet
no, there are literally 2 separate locker rooms for them
Hey man you got QB of future + Alshon who's a beast. Plus a guy like Christian McCafrey y'all gonna draft. Future promising man
The Eagles will go 7-9 and cement themselves into being nothing more than average for the next five years
These are stone cold facts man lol we're going to be like 2-14 lol but I still can't wait for season
Hey @NFL now that preseason schedules are out....what date will u release the regular season schedules.....plzzzzzzz begging you whennnn

Certainly. The 8pm EST game is open to all teams. The @nyjets have hosted the game twice. 2010 against the Bengals and 2012 against the Pats
If this LSU RB is elite, then use him as bait to trade down and add picks. Taking a RB to me is not so wise when you have no O-Line or QB.
Make sure it's Deshaun Watson.
Go back to bed. I think you need more sleep.

Let it go @PSchrags QBs are going to be over drafted but any team taking aone inthefirst round might as well get an F grade @nyjets @Giants
I want the @nyjets to bring in johnathon Hankins for a visit & ink him #nyj4LIFE

The only acceptable karma for this is for him to be drafted by the @NYJets ! @MikeAndMike
Trade: Richardson and one of our thirds to move into the 2nd. Get Adams (1st), Tre'Davious White (2nd), and maybe an edge rusher (2nd)??
I know you're high in Leonard Fournette. Even with the depth at safety and corner is the draft, what do you think of drafting Adams at 6?
I was reading who the @nyjets were gonna choose in the draft. @NMLit
Always optimistic #JetUP
How much 3 step drops do you expect from Morton's version of WestCoastOffense? Progression reads have to super sharp for WR#2 if used a lot
what skill players/positions will flourish more in the new offense ? Also which Te if OJ is off board will jets pursue?
why is Wilkerson and decker still on the team feels like dead weight
Assuming they don't take a CB in the 1st round are there any good 2nd round CBs available? #NYJetsMailbag

@nyjets should have the best system in the #NFL for development of QBs! That is their weakness!
With Nick Mangold now gone. Will the Jets make a move for Ethan Pocic, LSU he's viewed as best centre in the draft.
Why do you cover the jets and hate them?
How much coke are you on?
Do you see New England being favored by 18+ points in the first match up with NYJ in 2017?

Trubisky is Sanchez with a lot less upside don't do it @nyjets
It doesn't mean he is any good! Cleveland is just as desperate as the jets for a QB and they let him go! WhAt does that tell you?!
Leonard Fournette is the absolute best offensive player in the draft, there's no one else in the league that'll be like him
They aren't good enough to be in the top 5, they'll be gone by the late first round or early second
Yea, but look at what u need, it's offense

The edge perfromances at the combine were so disappointing. It's Myles, Solomon and Derek Rivers for me.
in round 3 maybe lol
Is Tim Williams still a thing?
Not by the Jets.
They're just gonna take him at 6
I culd name 20 players just lmk
You will never see a qb get injured as much as Josh McCown will lol
They are going to continue this trend with Charles harris.

Can't wait for the draft!! Can't wait for the season!!
But he sucks
@nyjets I know you like your corners tall, but let me tell you something Corn Elder is the whole package as CB, plays bigger than size 3rd r
@nyjets Marcus Maye plays fast n under control at all times, plus he is a playmaker creates fumbles for his team to recover, get him 2nd r
@nyjets Go draft players that will do their job! Patrick Mahomes, Marcus Maye,Corn Elder,Jake Butt,Elijah Hood,Desmond Smith,Marquell Lee
Crap is crap
@nyjets We don't need a corner with size that struggles tackling, get Corn Elder he plays bigger than his size n is excellent tackler
@nyjets Elijah Hood is this years version of Jordan Howard get him in 5 round. He is underrated
@nyjets Jake Butt is an excellent TE who can block and make contested catches, get him late 3rd or Gerald Everet
@nyjets Corn Elder has speed, physicallity and has great a tackling technique get him top 3rd round
@nyjets Marcus Maye is a playmaker way better than a lot of the safeties in this draft get him 2nd r
Give @TheSergioGarcia a call @nyjets
@nyjets Not to mention both Marcus Maye n Corn Elder r playmakers
@nyjets Both Marcus Maye n Corn Elder have speed, physicallity n r great at tackling
@nyjets Draft Patrick Mahomes, Marcus Maye, Corn Elder, Jake Butt, Elijah Hood, Demsond Smith, Marquell Lee

They just gotta keep on drafting a QB until they finally Get One! It's a QB Driven League! We need to have Our Rodgers Or Luck, 48 Years!!!!
Who said this? His dad? Lots of QBs leave it all out there.
when you give no effort it doesn't matter how old you are
this guy is fucking horrible
@nyjets Once you get Watson then you keep drafting & Building your team from there!
I've come around to drafting him. I also wouldn't mind trading down and getting more picks.
@nyjets You get a Kid like Watson everything changes, there's suddenly a light maybe at the end you can maybe see a little!

When @nyjets twitter tries to hype you up for nothing #NewYorkHypeBeasts
I believe the last 24 starts he's had, he is 2-22..
Please do not try to sell us on McCown. We all know why he is here. If he sees the field it means you are drafting a QB high in 2018

Agreed. I know we've a good players at RB position. Course a RB drafted its good to increase that position. ....

Nice! Gonna be checking it out real soon!
The NY Jets Fan Supporter Club shop https:// squareup.com/store/gothamci tycrew … (We print our shirts in house so the shirt is premium quality)
Sounds like a @nyjets move lol. Win some meaningless games and lose out on a stud in the draft
Where can I get one of those??
These would b a great addition 2 that collection (. @DianaNJTarHeel said our shirts feel like butter) . @RealJoeNamath . @nyjets #JetUp #Jets pic.twitter.com/qpx8lpYanP

@nyjets how many retweets for an internship in your marketing department
@nyjets Our Dline guys will play better with a better secondary, we can't stop any pass
@nyjets I know you love Harris but we can't be looking to draft another DE we have 3, 1st rounders n 2 3rd rounders.We need secondary help
Here’s my 2017 prediction on @nyjets linebacker #DavidHarris . #NYJets #GangGreen #NewYorkJets http:// ow.ly/RhHG30aHsLC pic.twitter.com/bELt4Ar1iR
#ManciniReport w/ @ReverendRalph as we talk @nyjets and the #6 pick! QB?? #GAWS
Or the NY Jets Fans all chipped in 2$ each @nyjets
We have bigger needs. Forte and Powell will do fine.stop drafting "best available player" and start drafting "best available player we need"
@nyjets did you sign rumble and ruin two sports

As a Stampeders and Patriots fan, don't like this deal ahah, Ojo is a very good player
Can we get some baddies and no more stick figures please? No one cares about how well they dance just hire the hottest ones there please.
@nyjets which one should be my profile picture? pic.twitter.com/JAWi2bLyJW
@rainser Of course he had to sign with the lousy Jets. Lol Praying for John.
@nyjets I hate you guys
Yes! You're highly skilled, experienced, with fresh legs! Come on jets!
Sorry by true champs you mean the 15 win team that lost to the 8 win team who are the ACTUAL champs? THOSE stampeders?
Except he's awesome and will make opponents his bissshhhh
Now that would be cool out there with Beachum @KelvinBeachumJr
If Denver grabs him in done with donkies. I already #BoycottNFL but ill b pissed
Get it ..we need u
Good job
Happy birthday
Most aren't even working at your level, how are they running the #world , Vaynerchuk for #president & I'm not talking about the @nyjets .
You're talking about different players playing different postitions. If this guy turns into a HOF cornerback rub it in my face
Watched some videos on this guy I rather get Brandon Flowers or some other CB just saying
https:// youtu.be/4AlNFq1PKO0 all I know. @NFL @RamsNFL @nflnetwork @Patriots @ChicagoBears @Chargers @dallascowboys @Chiefs @RAIDERS @nyjets
So, Cameron Wake was desperate? How about Jeff Garcia? Warren Moon? Joe Theismann? The CFL is better than you think.
I'm ready now @nyjets https:// twitter.com/temporal_natur e/status/850842877919887360 …
It all depends would the Browns wait to trade w/ Jets or just leap frog to Tennessee?
Racking up some top picks would be great for the Jets. Would love to see Mac do just that.
I hope we trade back to 12 pick up 33 or 54 take OJ Howard
DEEP DRAFT, stop worrying about top-3. There's depth: Wayne Gallmam Clemson and Jamal Williams out of BYU are 2nd-4th round guys= studs
If we trade and get that extra pick. I could pass on Fournette.
But the Big 3 are Fournette, Cook and McCaffrey. I don't see all 3 lasting by the time Jets 2nd pick comes around.only If we get n xtra pick
Also this is the deepest RB draft in last decade, plenty of starters in this class. I'm a value guy, let's take advantage of that
If we are gonna grab a back I'd love to steal Joe Muxon although Macc's wife does domestic violence work so that ain't happening lol
@nyjets
We all have different opinions. Who's your Selection?
Saturday swing game on @nyjets @thecatman39 #gomd @Charlotte, North Carolina https://www. instagram.com/p/BSo8-YTFvnG/
Don't agree with that analysis at all
Works for me
The @nyjets would be smart to grab a player with the character and talent of @DarnellJamar_ ! We on the Jersey Shore know he can play! https:// twitter.com/kristianrdyer/ status/850489159089344513 …
Sorry lol, but I'm in love with Fournette. I Believe he will be a Top back who can take over a game. I think the others are not that type
Not imo. First round at #6 is a bit too high for my taste. Plenty of talent in this draft. To whom is best, Fournette would get my nod.
None and no
Which RB in this year's draft is the best and should the Jets take him with their 6th pick?
Cmon, you're a @nyjets reporter.. how doesn't it "matter".. who cares about 'buzz'... realistically who should jets draft 1st two rounds...
pic.twitter.com/WkqCjatxAm
Hey @nyjets fans, @OlympiaSports stores here in NY have @EricDecker87 jerseys marked down, do they know something we don't know?
Thrown in the Jets as well @nyjets

Thanks big cat and give him a WAHOOWA for me haha #TJSIX
Great that question will be on list! Make sure you follow @TheJets_Zone where link will be posted!
Ahhh ok, I just wanted to know where he would place himself among UVA RBS... sooo I guess I'll go w/ how did TJ get his start in film
He's a great story would love to see him succeed and be half the back TJ was
It'll be about his NFL career overall, his time w/ Jets, his new movie 'Choke Hold' coming out and more!!!
Does it HAVE to pertain to jets football? (No offense) lol
Deep down he wants to come back to Denver
He don't even wanna go back to yall. Yall disrespected my mans
@nyjets @EricDecker87 Let Decker come home
We both love our 2nd favorite team @nyjets so who should they draft at #6? #NFLDraft @nyjetscenter @jetstwit @wesleywalker85 @660JoeBenigno
I'm honestly pumped to see the day when @garyvee buys the @nyjets
I wish this organization would take more time build a winning team than building a cheerleading squad.
It don't matter , we just need corners bottom line. If he can lock it down then it don't matter where he came from.
Who are the @EdmontonEsks ? #GoStampsGo #TrueChampions #IsItJuneYet ? #CFLisAWESOME

@nyjets I like the NYJets approach to the draft. No need to spend money on players whom are not consistent. FA 1 year contract, smart.
@nyjets don't draft a QB! Rnd1 Edge- Barnett Rnd2 OT-Dion Dawkins Rnd3 CB- Brian Allen Rnd4 C- Orlosky Rnd5 WR- R. Davis #DraftTwitter
@nyjets I really like Jake Butt as a TE if you r looking into Jordan Legget, I think Butt is better
I Hope the Jets draft James Conner this year, what he thinks about the young RB? Can he be the next Thomas Jones????

@nyjets You look at Andrew Luck, you see Dak Prescott! Maybe Trubisky or Watson is like them. Smart Kids who are almost ready to take it!!!!
@nyjets This team doesn't need anymore projects at QB! Go get one of these Polished Kids who can maybe step in sooner rather than later!!!!!
@nyjets You can get any position player on offense, Defense & special teams through trades & free agency but you can never get that QB!
@nyjets Gotta keep Drafting QB's until you find that Franchise for the next 10 plus years! Someone like an Andrew Luck! It's been 48 years!!
@nyjets The Main Focus for the jets is getting Trubisky or Watson with that 1st RD pick for the Fanbase to show there's Hope for the future!

@nyjets looks like I and many others won't be buying tickets to see this "band-aid" team. Way to treat your loyal fans
you like the Idzikian draft M.O??
No realistic chance either with this owner
great point- ownership is clueless , PSL is a disgrace #wasteof $ No Playoff home games for decades!
NO- lost last game to Bills in 15' Team leaders quit in 16' We have witnessed the future,only a matter of time +He's out
No free pass but I'll keep him as a defensive coordinator
Record shouldn't matter but he has to develop the young talent and he has to improve in game management and locker room chemistry
This teams choices get more pathetic by the week. There not eben playing and im already aggrivated. Suck suck suck!
Ownership is the root cause and that is where the change must occur first. 7 year PSL holder and no hope of home playoff game in future

What is Matt Millen now working fior Jets? He of 3 years picking WR in 1st round who couldnt play worth a lick....
@DarrylSlater now that PHI set market for DL with Jernigan trade, what do @nyjets do with Sheldon? Use him more effectively or trade option?
Wow, if those highlights were the preview, I can't even imagine the movie
I haven't tweeted anything in 508 days (i did the math) and I can't imagine a better cause to come out of retirement for #getbigredintheNFL

Why r u jets Mets fan being from the south
she always joked I was the perfect southern New Yorker @Mets and @nyjets fan
@nyjets draft this guy https:// twitter.com/mojuice5/statu s/849016333618597889 …
Basically, take the best Running Back available. Which is Leonard Fournette, if u can't get a QB, get a powerful running back.
@nyjets trade out of the 6 and get picks
naw GA bred percent @nyjets jet's fan since thirteen Mets and Celtics fan Something about the Knicks i cant pull for

@nyjets pic.twitter.com/j8TJx8GT7t
y we could just take Howard hes gonna b a game changer i promise
ROLB = C- MLB = C LOLB = C+
Wide out Mike Williams wouldn't be a bad pick either but I agree a top running back like those 2 take pressure off hack!
QB = D+ RB = C+ WR = B,C+,F OT = C OG = B- C = D- TE = C- DT = A- DE = B+ CB = C+ SS = B- FS = B-
HALL OF FAME LONG OVERDUE

Shoutout to ray I played against him in his blue tide days
The biggest @nyjets question mark that nobody is talking about... http:// nydn.us/2oJFjwH pic.twitter.com/rJUWoLEgWC
Some bum jets are
QB- F RB- C Oline- D TE- Z WR- C
Last real TE we had was Mickey Shuler
Jets fans using a Patriots win to talk trash...hopefully the @nyjets disown you for such a pathetic attempt.
My @nyjets sundae tasted like decades long desperation https:// twitter.com/Super70sSports /status/850116869340188672 …
Brutal. Another 2nd round pick that's not panning out.
Do the opposite of what you think.

Trade back....I don't trust you guys.
Exactly
@JCaporoso mahomes as 6! #Jets @nyjets
Let's go jets , I wanna see jets playing super ball next season
@nyjets #179 Tony Scott #NotTomBrady
No mention of devin smith whatsoever during the WR talk
Bye
Draft an impact offensive player in @_fournette or @dalvincook . Start @chackenberg1 Week 1!
make it simple draft @JabrillPeppers and go 2-15 with a simple and then get u another piece
What do you think about Peppers... maybe not as 6 ,but as us getting him
3 weeks until the #NFLDraft . Where do our position groups stand right now? A look at the offense → http:// nyj.social/2oFSlvH pic.twitter.com/oYLeMFCO3i
#none
New offensive co ordinater so will use more this season
even 1998 Steve Young isn't winning more than 5 games with this team
@MattStoneABC
. @NYJets sign former Chiefs tight end Brian Parker http:// nydn.us/2oKdlko pic.twitter.com/50D4SQ7SWP
Awesome! Now use him rather then never throw him the ball like every TE that has been on the roster in the last 5 years!
BREAKING: @NYJETS SIGN TE #BRIANPARKER #JETSARMY #JETUP #JETS #jetsnation #ganggreen #nyjets … https://www. instagram.com/p/BSjx3ygDJip/
who the hell is he??????!!!!!!! Patriots salivating
I give the fuck up..
None.. all a smk screen .. maybe QB from Cal or Texas tech
Offensive linemen
The @nyjets have signed TE Brian Parker. #NYJets #nfloffseason
how bout a RB?
Amazing pic.twitter.com/miEmwc1Gq1
@jason_walker24
#ThingsIWontApologizeFor How much I simultaneously love and hate my favorite teams. @Mets @NYRangers @nyjets @nyknicks
My IQ just dropped a few points.
Watching the @nyjets this season is going to horrible as usual. But at least we don't need to listen to @PhilSimmsQB biased blather...
Big deal
Hey @BrianCoz can you take care of this guy again?
Yes.....His name is Jason Vander Laan @jvanderlaan15 and he is already on your roster. Your coaches should love the options he gives you.
The QB always matters!
Not even close, Trubisky has WCO skills, Pocket bulldog hard to sack like Big Ben and reads multiple Progression&leads WRs, aka extra YAC
Build a good and solid supporting cast first, use current QBs to solidify them, then next year get a real QB to complete
Who?
because they suck and will always suck stop reporting on them and pick a professional football team to report on
LMAOOOOOO
Why it doesn't matter who wins the @nyjets quarterback competition... http:// nydn.us/2oJyOtW pic.twitter.com/G0iamL4I48
Now we need a QB that can throw a pass he can catch
who?
Yo @nyjets stop tweeting and make moves
