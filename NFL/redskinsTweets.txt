Aunque sea un incidente menor? sin cargos?
Apparently an algorithm removed him but, it really depends on parameters. I wonder if #UnitedThugAirline would have abused a pregnant gal?
Cunningham or Mixon
Good question!
Both are quality players at a position of need if cousins is not signed by draft day we might want to go QB to have a back up plan. Sign KC

If he had been Muslim, would that have happened???
Davis Webb was never Jared Goff's backup, transferred this season from Texas Tech
Never been in trouble in DC. Has a very small cap hit with upside at position of need. Not sure why the push to get rid of @JovaisG .
Guess they're waiting for his sack total to equal his arrest total.
Does he get credit for not using a belt this time?
Yea hes basically done imo, Skins just can't just simply ignore this since hes going to be suspended yet again.
How many chances does Junior Galette get, @Redskins ?
@Redskins Shake up the Draft, right before the event happens, Sign Cousins Long Term #HTTR
So Junior Galette has now gone from beating women with belts, to assaulting dudes and fleeing police. The @Redskins must be so proud
Cunningham likely won't be an option that late in the second.
No way Cunningham is available that late
With the 49th pick in the draft the Washington Redskins....Sign Kirk!!! #PayTheMan

. @PatrickMahomes5 . I'm not sold on Brantley or Cunningham and we still haven't solved our QB problem past this year.
Is this really a big deal? #httr
left guard or RB ?
Will Blackmon was better than Breeland. Breeland wants to be a no.1 corner but can't cover no.1 receivers. He's not that good
forrest fucking lamp in either the 1st or 2nd i don’t care bring back the HOGS
Don't blame that on him poor scene n play calling having him cover one of the best wr with no safety help Norman should have followed him
Murphy suspended. Breeland is good if you like Antonio Brown twerking in the end zone at FedEx field. Long is average. 1/4 try again
Work Young Fella!!! #HTTR
Never Mixon
With no first round pick- Murphy, Moses, Long, Breeland in his only draft. I'll take that
And the Presidential physical fitness challenge, you know who changed it, after more than 50 years
Brantley
I would go with Brantley
Brantley
Just don't pick Peppers, Obi, Humphrey or Adoree at 17 and I'm good.
I would be good with either one...

@Redskins OLB Galette arrested. Does anyone see the need for an edge rusher? Murphy, not unless he's on PED's. Smith, WAKE UP! Who's left?
That's a photo of a wealthy man! Humiliated and man-handled. I hope he sues the shirts off of United.
It really was great wasn't it? Don't forget the DARE program as well.
85% of passengers on airlines have no etiquitte dr is a prime example
think the "doctor" needed a bit of maturity-strange how a grown man could act that way-he is at fault
the so called dr is an embarassment to drs-he was at fault crazy man

Your right to many on drugs out here! Like the guy before that had a problem with Trumps spending! Drugs see Wrist!

You're blaming Trump for this!? ... What next, tornadoes kill a minority, and he gets the blame? You're pathetic.
They could still cut bait. They only signed him to 800K deal to bring him back. That is chump change to Snyder.
i would not fly with @united after that i bet the guy sues @united

United should be bankrupt in 6 months becsuse of no one willing to fly the combative sky's with them. Dint need a boycot just common sense
Out of all bad decisions I have seen companies make this is one of the top 10 ever! I could guide UA better than current ceo
United CEO and leadership all need fired tomorrow. How a management team of such a large company can be so ignorant is unblievable
Imagine how things go when you fly the unfriendly skies

69 year old doctor this is sickening
Perfect!
FYI, the @UnitedAirlines twitter handle has been disabled and locked. It was active a few hours ago. Use @united instead. It is support
LMAO
It is a stupid policy
Just like ISIS randomly chooses victims to execute
As a @Redskins fan I have a newfound respect for @RashadJennings . That was beautiful.
OF ALL PASSENGERS THEY PICK ASIAN COS THEY KNOW THEY CAN GET AWAY W/ IT. IMAGINE THEY DRAG A BLACK MAN OUT,UNITED WOULD BE IN BIGGER TROUBLE
Probably illegal or sleeper cell anyway
I promise, if I'm watching the draft and the @Redskins don't pick up @CMcCaffrey5 I'm throwing my phone and crying myself to sleep.
@tress_way From one Sooner to another, I'd love to try my hand at "Balls of Fury" against the mighty @Redskins punter. #PingPong
That's why I'm thinking standby. Jury is still out.
Gotta luv #the45ths racist america #BoycottUnitedAirlines
That's why I fly American most of the time. I'm not sure I've ever been on a United flight.
Very possible it could've been standby. Haven't heard any real details yet. Maybe this guy could claim discrimination . Y did they pick him?
The friendly sky's that volunteers you to leave the plane for their employees to fly then batter the person and calls them belligerent
Absolutely disgusting. This airline needs to be shut down!
This doctor had a patient waiting for him. He did not deserve to be treated like this. Damn you @united
CEO apologized for “having to reaccommodate these customers.” Really? Company's actions and their response inhumane. #volunteertoflydelta
How in the... ?? How'd u manage that ?
Yeah!! Lawsuit!!!
When you have so much money and become so powerful and treat people like commodities it's time to show United who pays the bills. Boycott!!
F United
Right. Disgusting but not surprising anymore.
Fearless. Never remember him calling for a fair catch. One of my favorite Redskins to watch when growing up!
Looked crazy. First class, next flight, $500.00 voucher, I'm up. I'm betting now, this guy was flying standby.
I am sure that united escalated situation & there were multiple personnel there who probably didn't even understand y an assault occurred.

I'm sorry. I mispelled f*ck off.
Police were watching, but the person who assaulted the man looked almost like tarmac personnel.
Pay what?

Cops, TSA are more like Security Officers with no powers of arrest.
Wasn't United legging were American an never let them on. Free fliers because of family employee. Violated dress requirement. Pay attension.
This makes me so upset! That poor man I feel so sorry 4 him
Those were TSA or cops.
If I say on line it wont be a secret any more. ill yell you one on one.
He did... he bought his ticket arrived on time was seated then refused to give up his seat 4 a late arriving united employee! #assbeat
Not much choice down here, but there HAS to be more to the story.
@Redskins I think you guys should draft @JabrillPeppers that's one guy you just can't miss out on #take the chance
He should've went Bruce Lee, Jet Li or Jackie Chan on them! Fight or flight! No pun intended!!
#firebruceallen . That is all.

Better let your friends know to use up their miles before United becomes divided.
The Moves the @Redskins Have Made Makes Me Think they r Going RB at 17 but Top 2 May be Gone- If So, Defensive Pick At 17 is a Better Option
Life a box of chocolates,,,,
Me either.
Air Canada here, there and everywhere w/Star Alliance airlines for local flights eg Munich Zurich w/Lufthansa. Not that I'm biased
None of whom will ever see another dime of my money.

I used to check Military Id,s s you came onto post
This poor man! Seeing cops' behavior at the airline's behest (obviously; they didn't send them in with a compensation check) is outrageous!
There are many great Law Enforcement Officers out there and most never have to draw their weapon or let alone shoot someone
Is that how people act in China? Throw temper tantrums?

Oh yeah.

I take it your not a Military Veteran then other wise you would know what a MOS is
My Military job was Military Police nothing fancy about it I spent most of my time at the Gates
damn
Ima wear a hijab to stay safe
Agree 100% and they should have!!
United could of put its Employees on another Air Lines and saved everyone the trouble.
MOS?
My MOS was 31-B I would tell United Airlines employees to do their own dirty work and I would walk myself off the plane.
Sure, very possible. Notice how everyone quick with their camera phones, but NO ONE quick to stand up and volunteer. Think about that.
Discusting!!! Buh bye United!
pic.twitter.com/pea9NiFEGv
Not all Police Officers would be willing to drag a man off the plane for not giving up his seat. I would tell them to choose another person
Makes you wonder about them having a random passenger generator.
Already added them to my boycott list. Over charge and over book then offer next to nothing. No takers call the cops.

Stop, or I'll say stop again! To what point should one go before using force?
put on leave until investigation is typical. He will be back as he did nothing wrong.
Terrible incident.
Boycott @united and sue @united until it bankrupted.
And a wrong way to do the job the Police Officer is not a credit to the men in blue.

Long Redskins fan skins need a good running back who can run threw the holes without the fumbles
We'll see about that come April 27.
If the Skins O Line is so good why were their running backs hit in the backfield so often. They take turns missing their blocks, that's why!

The Redskins offensive line is going to have to be better, and stronger. Stop getting pushed into the backfield or get replaced!!!
Zeke was helped along by those 5 yard wide gaps in the line. When he got hit in the backfield he got no more yardage than fat rob did.
We need a high quality, power RB like Zeke. Keep looking! HTTR
RFK when it was all about winning on the field and not all about the business side of things as it is now...

Now it is the worst field in the league
How about best football stadiums for baseball. I loved RFK. Other teams hated to play there. Now FedEx is always filled with opponents fans.

McGee to be used as d end. Once again we sign a player and use him in a position he doesn't play... @redskins
i mean how do u expect college defensive lineman to be able to keep up with and make plays against nfl caliber running backs ?
@Redskins Do you think Brady loving Trump means you are only the second most racist team in sports?
eh they weren't dominant. perhaps their lack of speed is why the redskins gave up so many yards against the run this past season
That is also true & it's not a big deal if he is still dominant. I.e. Brandon Sheriff. I have concerns... l.e. S. Cravens at ILB, Clearly SS

They look great
We take a strength and make it a weaknesses. Like leaving L. Landry in space against D. Jackson for a 88 yard TD on 1st play in 2011
Welcome to Washington.
That's true but we've constantly moved players out of position. W. Blackmon, Sua. Cravens, A. Haynesworth, A. Archuleta to name a few.
HTTR!!
Just because a player is in one position in college doesn’t mean that it’s his “natural” NFL position. College, NFL games very different.

Allen says staying at Bama was a win-win http:// es.pn/2nMdorg #RollTide @Redskins #17 pick
I'm old enough to remember when the @Redskins had their QB ( @KirkCousins8 ) of the future.
Great news John, good luck when you play against the Bills LOL.
I would LOVE for us to draft Buddy Baker, but think our FO is sold on Swearinger being the answer (which I'm not at all) w/ Cravens.
He will be great
The @Redskins defeated the NY Giants 13-3 in their #FirstGameEver (as the Washington Redskins). Now it's time for the @WashingtonValor .

@Redskins No thank you! No more RG3 style running QB's. You have a good QB already. Sign @KirkCousins8 to the LTD. Make it work.

no idea. i don't think so, but always depends on who's available and who they like.
Why not tell us what the deal with Cousins is?
Not a COMPLIMENTARY one, I take it???
Great Return Man A key part of our Super Bowl run
Serious @redskins fan, spotted in the @ralphsgrocery parking lot in #marinadelrey .... @Ralph's… https://www. instagram.com/p/BSl6DUSjJuQ/
I certainly hope so, we've had more than our share of players with untapped potential play or better yet, try to play for us.
Best of luck!!!
