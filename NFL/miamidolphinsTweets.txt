Last year, 31 wide receivers were taken in the draft. Who gets their name called first this year? https:// cards.twitter.com/cards/btiww/40 xl7 …
@MiamiDolphins Richard Sherman and Jabril Peppers make it happen!
This is so awesome!
And I don't!

@NFLUK @MiamiDolphins @VictorWanyama @SpursOfficial what squad you rep my man?? Chelsea boys taking it this year
he looks like jermaine defoe.
the only time I feel like he would be alright is if he played strong safety and played in the box a lot... MAYBE
Exactly...like this guy said he wants to play free safety but has shown 0 ballhawking skills whatsoever lol makes no sense
he's trash. He never showed up in big games, two small to play LB and to shit to play safety
@mattproctor25 our favorite teams getting along well
Fantastic to have @nfl_uk @miamidolphins star @god_son80 at Hotspur Way today! https://www. instagram.com/p/BStjyLKDsRU/
Such a waste of a first round pick lol
in the same boat.. if the giants draft him, wooooo, you won't hear from me ever again
Hearing a lot of stuff so I'm warning you, draft Jabril peppers at 22 & im jumping off a building, it'll be on your hands @MiamiDolphins
Forrest Lamp at 22 & we're goin to the Super Bowl @MiamiDolphins https:// twitter.com/scottbarrettdf b/status/847252096256622593 …

I've been a fan since 2004 wasn't die hard until 2013 because my grandfather is a fan and we watched their games when I was a kid
Since 71. My moms family being there and me too when I was a kid. 72 sealed it. Last 2 years made me a lifer
'71. first SB appearance b/c my brother was a fins fan. 46 yrs.
I have been a fan 30 years. I became a fan after watching Dan Marino and been hooked ever since.
Shula , Csonka , Morris , Griese & Warfield . Since 71 and raised my boy a fan too
Loved running teams. Ronnie brown and Ricky Williams helped me fall in love with the team in 2005. Been a fan ever since. #FinsUp
Since '94. Father is a Dolphins fan and I became one, too.
Dad moved to Miami when my he was about 4. He grew up as a fins fan, and I was born a fins fan. My son will carry it on too!
We're old lol
Same, 18 years
Was born into it. My father was born in Miami and even my grandfather, who was from NY, was a Fins fan. Been one my entire life.
they were in the super bowl when i was 2.5 years old... can't say i remember anything about it . shame, as it's not happened since.
my mom was born in miami and raised me a dolphins fan. she made my dad, a former jet fan, "convert" before marriage. her passion is in me.
My father and been 17 years of being a fan
We moved to Miami right after the perfect season. I've been a fan for over 40 years now.
I was born in Miami, lived there through undefeated season. Life long fan so 53 years so far.
this story now makes me wish they did more games in europe, especially preseason. you're an official die hard these days. :)
it was the Fins and Broncos over here...Marino-Elway...not bad for a preseason game
1985 dolphins vs bears saw the Marino magic and the rest is history.
birth, 37 years.
never knew your origin story. pretty cool.
@MiamiDolphins how many retweets for free tickets to a home game?
'92...Fins played a preseason game in Berlin...didn't miss a game since
How did you do that?
@MiamiDolphins don't pass on Peppers come back around and take LB TJ Watt. IT DOES NOT matter 1st Rd 2nd Rd target these two
Uncle was a Dolphins fan in the 70's. Started watching with him during 1984 season, Marino was magic and we went to SB. Fan for 33 years!
Fan since '83. Was a kid watching @MiamiDolphins vs Raiders when @DanMarino came into the game. I was hooked.
Family used to live in Miami and converted to dolphin fans. Aqua and orange has been in the family's blood since the 70's
#Tebow is a gamer- @NFL @Browns @ChicagoBears @Jaguars @HoustonTexans @RamsNFL @49ers @MiamiDolphins @nyjets @buffalobills you blew it!
My feet didn't reach the end of the couch cushion looking up at dad and uncle cheering on Phins. Grew up in south fl. 30+ years for life
I was born a Dolphins fan, raised that way. So 22 years
David "Never" Fales led U.S. in passing 72.5%, Tossed 6 TDs, 547 yds (37 of 45) to beat undefeated Derek Carr's Fresno State 62-52 #SJSU
Became a fan in 2010 because I started playing football in high school ... never looked back
Aside from the logo and colors, I traded a Bernie Kosar card for an OJ McDuffie back in 1st grade. I've been a fan ever since, 25 years tbh
I moved to SoFla in 1983 When I saw Marino humiliate the '85 Bears on national TV, I was hooked. Been chasing the dragon ever since. #FinsUp
@Houtz @PerfectvillePod @lit_phins @travis_writes @PhinsiderRadio @OliCool13 @FinsBroadcaster @xFinsUp @aoliver714 @DolphinDiehards #speakup
I have been a Miami Dolphins fan since 1995 all because of the color green & Dan Marino's fantastic accuracy shoot glad it wasnt the Jets!

Willis will be there and I think Barnett will too
@LanceZierlein Who do you think has a better shot to fall to my @MiamiDolphins ? Barnett, Reddick (I want), Jabril Peppers, Jordan Willis?
Guess the @MiamiDolphins and @StLouisBlues are next.
Any deals for staying also getting tickets to a @MiamiDolphins game?
Thanks man! This stuff really makes a difference to us!

There's a few I like. But at 22, for value and IMMEDIATE STARTER status, I gotta go with Forrest Lamp.
Which prospect that's reportedly visited the team would you be most excited for the @MiamiDolphins to take at no.22? #NFLDraft
@MiamiDolphins Please tell me we aren't looking for D line help in the draft. LB OL those are the big needs.

I miss the Marino years. I am truly blessed to have had the opportunity to watch such a great quarterback play for my team
@MiamiDolphins are you serious you like the situation then expect more pathetic seasons. We need a winning QB. Wake up ross & do something.
I should have worn an aqua tux. :)
Sherman is on the market... @MiamiDolphins should throw a 3rd Rd pick at Seattle and a corner just to test the waters .he's a top corner
And you're 4 days late to the conversation. Goodbye.

Landry and a 2nd is too much tho, a 2nd would probably be enough if Seattle actually does want to move him
This is way too much for an aging overpaid system corner bro
@OmarKelly should the @MiamiDolphins consider giving up the same for Richard Sherman that the Bucs gave up for Revis (1 & 4 rd picks)?
Very possible he is.

I've said before that Dak would suk if he had of been picked by the Jets I expect Ryan to have a great yr, but if the OL crumbles, he won't
Agreed but I saw a ranking that had Prescott ahead of him. You think he can do anything w|o the Great Wall of Dallas?
OK, I'm not quite as sold, but his biggest issue is Pocket Presence, he's no Russel Wilson. he needs a really good OL to reach his potential
I agree. If we ever gave him a quality line, top 5.
The OL will be a big factor in Ryans success, we'll see, right now it's still pretty iffy and very little depth
We'd have the new legion with Jones Sherman And Maxwell
#BearsFan Watz Yo team? #Me @MiamiDolphins #Bearsfan Ryan Tannehill is some shit #me Cutler set you back 5 years & you're team not relevant

What about us Active Duty Military members stationed outside the state, who Love this team even more than some FL Residents? #TheNewMiami
Come this draft if @MiamiDolphins go 1st T/G Forest Lamp and 2nd S Marcus Williams, I'll consider it a A+ draft regardless of 3rd-7th.

Yo imagine the @MiamiDolphins had a decent QB to go with the best receiving core in the league
@MiamiDolphins I would give my right leg to draft @PatrickMahomes5

If yall ever want some more brilliance on the team let me know ! It's so crazy it would work @ChicagoBears @Saints @MiamiDolphins
We could always trade them &stars trade better it's a business no hard feelings but Daddy's gotta win @Saints @ChicagoBears @MiamiDolphins
You know what we need? Star players @MiamiDolphins @Saints @ChicagoBears @RAIDERS who cares if we already got a guy at that position #NFL
Yeah you could draft to your needs and not get a star or get a star and then trade for your needs @MiamiDolphins @ChicagoBears @Saints
I don't believe in drafting to your needs so much as I do drafting who's great @Saints @ChicagoBears @MiamiDolphins think about it
I hope the @MiamiDolphins @Saints @ChicagoBears or @RAIDERS draft Lawson honestly he's a can't miss
@ochocinco still got it, loved seeing him in a Dolphins uniform, would love to see it again. @MiamiDolphins #hightidepride

Fales >>> Tom Brady
It was an honor to meet the best coach in NFL history! Coach Shula you are amazing! #undefeated @DonShula @MiamiDolphins Thanks to my fam pic.twitter.com/ZmrzYWQIJq
I guess thats a upgrade from TJ Yates
The @Dodgers love to pick up ex @SFGiants like the @Patriots love to snag ex @MiamiDolphins
yessssss... this is the missing piece we've been waiting for #whocares
@MiamiDolphins better make a move on @RSherman_25
love u
@NFL 2017. Los @MiamiDolphins contratan al QB Davied Fales.
rather go back to the 1972 logo. Or at prior to the change in the mid 90s
LoL Fales getting a job before Krapernick. I love it. Take that u phony. "I will NOW $ tand for the national anthem"
Yup, this kid is definitely better than RGIII and Kap...
Let's go another pointless signing
He may be good but kinda embarassing for Dolphins to tweet this relative unknown as something for fans to get excited about.
@PerfectvillePod wish we would go back to the old 2010 logo @MiamiDolphins please
WHO????????
Congrats @dfales10 !!!!
Who???
I hope the Lord blesses you with a great team & a great opportunity! Selfishly I wish my @MiamiDolphins or the @Panthers draft you.
Who ?
@RSherman_25 can't help but think you'd be a huge piece to a deep Playoff run if the @MiamiDolphins had you.
Jay ajayi late to practice @MiamiDolphins pic.twitter.com/y2DqC5mq9O
Alright @Marlins 0-2....We must be doing the same thing as the @MiamiDolphins ? Guess we're playoffs bound
The 58th pick in the #onepickperday #FantasyFootball draft is the @MiamiDolphins ' @God_Son80
Why???
Who?
@TimothyGertz
SJSU SPARTANS!
His middle name is Rarely.
Dear 5 lb 4 oz new born baby Jesus, @MiamiDolphins don't touch him with a 50' pole https:// twitter.com/schadjoe/statu s/849760160650326018 …
Who?
But Kaep tho...
Faled
WHY

#championship
That's true I hope this seasons different dawg
i understand bro but the dolphins literally started 1-4 and everyone said the same shit..
Just little things that irk the shit outta you man
Just very reminiscent of Marlins of years past vro
we're literally not even 2 games in
San Jose State, outplayed Darick Carr in college head to head their Sr years.
New year same Marlins @MiamiDolphins we miss you
Other than the 2nd 5th round pick (WR), this is the best mock I've seen. Replace the WR with TE Jonnu Smith and it would be beautiful
Who the fuck is this nigga
Why
Fail
@John_Suter9 nice ...
Never heard of him back up to Jay Cutler i guess welcome to Miami make name of your self
He needs to name his son Epic
@DarthTodd44 Thank you for the follow! Enjoy these @MiamiDolphins photos with @3DBUMPERS pic.twitter.com/ExRRNCTR3l
Thanks.
0-16
ICYMI, the @MiamiDolphins signed a former Bears quarterback Wednesday ... David Fales.
Abuelo working out in a @MiamiDolphins jersey #goabuelo #dolphins
Heading into the 2017 season with one full season playing right guard. https:// cards.twitter.com/cards/btiww/3y 22w …
So the Bears unloaded two QBs known as fails?
@NFL @jeff_mcfarren
San Jose state university
Zach brown actually signed for 2.3 mil with 700 thou. Gtd good luck to him lol
@Kaepernick7 to @MiamiDolphins ?
San Jose State! Local
For not hearing of him, and from a bears fan, I can tell you the kid has talent. Never given the chance to prove it. He can be a solid BU
Here's the real story; our CEO @rjrogers87 (diehard @MiamiDolphins fan) lost a bet & therefore had to wear a @Patriots hat; #RibbonCutting pic.twitter.com/dJV4Svsg26
@MiamiDolphins IF @RSherman_25 ON TRADE BLOCK U GO GET HIM...
Not the best last name for a qb
@nflnetwork fale
Well he may do better than the last free agent signing. Substance abuse suspension and South Beach, what could go wrong
@KYLXIIIE My dad is going to be his number one fan now! Lol
Who?
Mike be honest, this just a troll RT isn't it? Isn't it!!! If so #wellplayed
They misspelled fails
TD!
Fales=fails. Said the same way.
A backup.
