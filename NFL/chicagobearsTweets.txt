Sweet and salty peanut!
Please don't take a safety with the third pick. Possibly the least important position in the starting 22.
Tough talk from a fan of a team that never won a Superbowl. I do love Brian Dawkins #beast .
@ChicagoBears go get @RSherman_25
Got money for jerseys but not for charity...Seems about right.
Watson or Trubizky come on down
Adams is what we need to sure up our secondary. Allen has arthritic shoulders. Solomon is a hybrid. Adams a need & a want.
Adams or watson please

#wethefans Go @ChicagoBears
We do but this draft is filled with ?s
Adams is a must. Linebacker in the 2nd. Offensive play maker in 3rd.
@BarstoolBigCat The @ChicagoBears should sign him as QB. He knows something about football so can't be worse than Cutler.
Hey @ChicagoBears y'all need a numbers guy? https:// twitter.com/barstoolbigcat /status/851595583823523840 …
Hell Yes! Can't wait to spend more of my money on this meaningless preseason football after the ticket increase, YES!
Episode 1 of "We the Fans" airs tonight at 10 ET on ESPN featuring the @ChicagoBears & the tough era we're stuck in.
My Prediction, Bears gonna suck again this season!!! 101%
Hopefully not another bust like in years past....
Yes go Bears I can't wait to see who they pick, 5 - 11 here we come!

Or watson
The bears should trade the pick for Rick Mirer
Take Cutler back you nitwits.
Got to love @MartysaurusRex ...thus @ChicagoBears misses him! Unicorn Pizza!
Just do not pick a QB, none are worth the gamble at #3
What's the difference? If you can't score points you can't win the ball game. Cutler was the Bears best chance
happy birthday
Happy birthday man! ^^
Bears are going to punt? Is that the same as trading back?

No I wont.
What?

LSU TIGER ADAMS BEAR DOWN CHICAGO

Damn Steelers can shut up
A damn QB
#CCCExchange panelists are top Chicago sports execs from @chicagobulls @ChicagoFire @whitesox and @ChicagoBears : http:// bit.ly/2ocS5k4 pic.twitter.com/guQtpnaQhV
I can't see Garret or Watson being there. So gimmie a safety because I can't handle another year of Adrian Amos.
Please draft Patrick Mahomes
Your gonna eat those words
hopefully not a punter
Trade up for myles Garrett <Ryan Pace>
Need more than 140 characters to explain how draft works to @andrewevans .
I can agree, I like him. I wouldn't be upset if they took him, but facing Rodgers 2x a year, a player like Adams could be great help.
Either Jamal Adams or Marcus Lattimore but I prefer Adams
don't know but pretty sure you'll blow it
Looks like @ChicagoBears , @Cubs , @whitesox will have to go to only day games. Maybe move @chicagobulls outside too. http://www. cnbc.com/2017/04/11/chi cago-wants-to-become-a-renewable-energy-powerhouse.html …
Make it A good pick!!!!
Yeah I really like Adams and believe he would be an instant Day 1 stud but also think DW4 has got something special about him
Let's hope it's a QB.
It better be a quarterback
Jamal Adams please!! I mean I already ordered a Bears jersey of his...if not I guess u owe me $150....balls in your court...lol!! #BEARDOWN
You see right through us...
Next years QB class is much better, I'd go Adams secure the secondary and get a QB next draft
Jamal Adams, can't pass on him.
Deshaun Watson or Jabrill Peppers
if it's not Deshaun Watson you guys are idiots and I'll go root for the packers for a year
pic.twitter.com/46zNzmAZRz
DeShaun Watson , Jamal Adams , Malik Hooker , Jonathan Allen
Better than a bust
Noooo Watson is a bust like Tebow
trade back
Hopefully not a punter...
The defense is fine all y'all need is a qb and a wr1. Other than that maybe a lineman but that's it
Jamal
Watson please and thanks
You're gonna draft Pat ODonnell?
Please trade down we need alot of players
Crappy promo, low OVRs, money greedy company, and bad pack odds. You ask why people quit, or why youtubers promote coin selling. This is why

are you also a @ChicagoBears fan?
I would think you could say a little more for the time he was here. Apparently he wore his welcome out with someone.
If they were gonna release anyone it should have been Fuller he doesn't want to play no ball he had a late surgery & didn't try to get back!
I sadly can, fucking Greenbay lol, but can't remember our last regular season game score lol

Lattimore and Hooker are both injury prone. Lattimore is the Alshon Jeffery of defense, with his injuries.
According to Ryan Pace it is best player available
It's got to be S. Thomas, J. Adams, or Fournette. Those are the elite talents in this draft.
Hmmm, Denver says there playing in Chi-town....

Today, What day! I met a doctor and she was the @ChicagoBears doc! Go bears! I visited Firenze and I met my favorite collegue @BrewDog pub!
That's why Drafting Watson at 3 would excite the fanbase

Dear @ChicagoBears @bears_insider @CSNBears @BearsNationCHI please draft @MylesLGarrett

I know it! Great player, great energy. No reason for this.
Bears really need help at this pos. Let's see how they work this
They are obviously going to replace him with a better free agent...patience
Who gives a F. Bye. Don't know how you stayed on the team when every an picked on you. You sucked. Good riddens
Kaep could do some good for the city and for the team. Sign him bruh. Yall dont have anything to lose honestly. @ChicagoBears
After getting shitty quarterbacks, no thanks
@ChicagoBears why would you delete that Rodgers tweet? You gotta own that. Spineless marketing just like the organization.
@ChicagoBears bears just plainly stink that are the facts boys

@ChicagoBears CB Tracy Porter has been released after a very tough 2016 season. #NFL
You just said it yourself....why the hell would we pay a guy 4M that needs to drain his knee every game lmao
Are you serious? We just signed like 15 defensive backs since FA started.....lmao

I was saying the same thing
Am I alone in wishing the best for veterans when they get released from @ChicagoBears - my support of them doesn't stop when the uni changes
the bears also saw potential in mark sanchez...
@ChicagoBears one word answers this "yes". pic.twitter.com/0pRuPQKYGe
pic.twitter.com/nLJUM0LFws
Porter had no more guaranteed money left in his contract and the Bears signed Marcus Cooper and Prince Amukamara to starter’s$
He couldnt cover a blind toddler at WR out there, good riddance!
@ChicagoBears hey @TheAdams_era
@ChicaGObears pic.twitter.com/YRMdNYdU85

He was always on the ground after getting beat for TDs... thank god he is gone 3.5$ mil a lot for a bum-ass CB

thank God he's gone

I miss this defense. Definitely there were better days to be a @ChicagoBears fan. https:// twitter.com/ChicagoBears/s tatus/851430846833713153 …
No doubt.
I think this pretty much guarantees it's gonna be Adams or Lattimore
why are we waiving good players?
@__TPorter__ Tracy Porter played half dead from injuries thats crazy @ChicagoBears @NFL teams still shitting on @Kaepernick7 #FUCKTHENFL
Thankyou @__TPorter__ @ChicagoBears @HoosierFootball
Definitely a bigger possibility now
I love my BEARS but some of the decisions that are made are truly mind fucking and don't make football sense lol

Draft this man @ChicagoBears https:// twitter.com/nflnetwork/sta tus/851453500827602948 …
@ChicagoBears we need Adams #DailyReminder
This is why you lose out on key free agents. The guy who drained his knee to play on Sunday gets cut. Treat your players better Bears!
#BearsLegend Thanks for the memories. Let's get back to defensive excellence. I'm predicting a top 10 defense this season.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
Him before Eddie Royal? Interesting
Well this just adds to the disappointment of this offseason
Good O days
@ChicagoBears you should build a building for real bears it would bring Revenue all year round 10/20 bears in a real environment awesome
I jus remember #beastmode1 ..when Porter got embarrassed like every other Saint, 1 of best runs EVER! When do you see a RB impact entire O?
Good
Tracy Porter was waived by @ChicagoBears today okay that's a good move hopefully we'll get ourselves a safety in the draft
Wave the whole front office
@BuffLlama Lattimore
Tracy Porter foi cortado pelo @ChicagoBears . Ano passado, havia assinado por três temporadas.
Bring back Peanut!!!
@ChicagoBears https:// twitter.com/bleacherreport /status/851445720053927940 …
He was old and slowing down
Lmao bears
Now waive Jon Fox
This is kinda hinting that the @ChicagoBears might pick Marshon Lattimore #3 overall? Hope so. https:// twitter.com/rapsheet/statu s/851444802658938881 …

Thank you!
Awesome player! Fox would have cut him!
First bears game I ever went to! I was sitting in that end zone and will never forget this moment!
that's the case every year though
I will never forget this play. Not ever. It was absolutely wonderful.
I remember that play like it was yesterday
Such as awesome moment
One of my favorite plays of all time. Bear down!!
One of my favorite interceptions in Bears history. #BearDown
O how I yearn for good defensive play no @ChicagoBears once again!
Remember watchin this game on TV w/ my dad & we became instant fans.Peanut changed how corners punch, poke, & strip the ball forcing fumbles
I get that you can only retire a few numbers, so put up a ring of honor to celebrate players and people like Peanut
Moss usually is the one doing that to DB's glad us fans got to watch Till Man play for years

We shall see. I heard him speak on a podcast and I like his maturity. Could be a sleeper
He sounds (from what I've read) like a more athletic Mike Glennon. I feel like his ceiling is higher than most think, will take time though.
Doesn't mean he doesn't have shitty grades w most teams
Man idk.. I been reading a lot on dude and it seems like he'd fit in a power/play action scheme. Plus he's coming from a pro system already.
I am I think he's a gonna be a great #2 with a few good years as a starter
Lmao you're drunk if you think dobbs is going in the 3rd round (I hope) but I actually want kaaya in the 3rd now that y'all killed my dream
You don't think that's high for Kaaya? I'm just not a believer
What y'all think about Brad kaaya or Josh Dobbs rd 3?

Due to absolutely no doing of his own. All defense.
It's the bears get over yourself. Probably better he is single. Then you can beat other teams besides the bears
Have trading card frim that game with weird Bears mascot can be seen on sidwline

@TheAdams_era to the @ChicagoBears end of story
@ChicagoBears Malik McDowell reminds me of a bigger, stronger, tougher and quicker version of Richard Dent. We can use that on the D line.
Can the @ChicagoBears have 2 of them! Thanks Every Bears Fan
@ChicagoBears really need to get Deshaun Watson with that third pick!!!
Not even the global Jewish conspiracy?We're that screwed?
Nothing can help the Bears
After you're finished in Hollywood, of course
Forget the Spurs, can you do anything about the @ChicagoBears ?

That was over two years ago with a whole different team and coaching staff who owned you in Lambeau in 2015 andyou can't count 2016 backups
your just sad cause it isn't cutler
@zachkruse2 @ChicagoBears @packers
Why is OL a huge need like DB is. These list are trash.
You played our backups in 2016 that don't count
Just remember who beat you and spoiled Brett farve night lol the last time cutler played in Lambeau field he owned you and Rodgers
That's pretty low and homophobic.
Y'all probably right. A guy can dream tho. He would be our Justin Smith
U can have a dream that Jay Cutler was the Bears' best QB ever
Oh yeah, the Bears are 2-15 against Aaron Rodgers.
Hater
This hurts. Miss you in a @ChicagoBears uniform, Robbie
No way, at best they might reach for Lenny but I'm pretty sure they not gone let sol get away. We probably going safety and I'm cool widdit.
That's easy...."Sweetness"
I been thinking he will too but I'm hoping the 9ers go for Allen
Im sure they will address QB in the later rounds. At least, I hope......
solo going number 2 guys move around
@super_sanni
Take Solomon Thomas, Awuzie, Marcus Williams in that order @ChicagoBears
How is QB not a priority for the Bears? They're paying Glennon as a one year starter, plus Pace can't hitch his wagon solely to Glennon.
Yeah, the NFL has been pretty bad the last couple seasons. I'm a big football fan and haven't been excited by the play in a while.
THIS is absolutely not true I present the @ChicagoBears , the @Browns & the @49ers https:// twitter.com/jdubsack/statu s/851062978875207681 …
Let's just hope @ChicagoBears don't "bargain hunt". No need to break the bank, but we need a QUALITY quarterback.
cant wait. cool stuff except for having to stare at goodells face for so long.

Even as Dan trashed my Titans for two uninterrupted seasons, I've loved everything he brings. ATNFL is equal parts Xs, Os, and bits.
#Visionary
It was when they started televising games. Stan & Bobby in the @CorvetteMs that I knew something was going on down there. #Timing
I guess anyone who was paying attention to when Toews and Kane were drafted. I didn't really pay attention to hockey back then. *shrug*
I did. Wish I have it for other things in life......
I believe it. Too bad I didn't have a crystal ball back then.
Yes. They've gone up over 100% since I got them in 2008.
At least you don't have to pay season ticket rate for ONE game (as peons like me would from SH just to get a seat in last row of 300s) :-P
OMG. 2/3"s of entire season just for 16 games. Unreal the prices.
And I'm guessing you only have to pay face value
You have to pay extra for those but get first dibs, yeah?
Not independently wealthy. Not sure where the is going to come from if/when @NHLBlackhawks get through RD 1.
Oh, cool! Well, good thing 1 of the 2 teams have been doing well. LOL (unless you have season tix for Bulls and Sox too) ;-)
Goes with them. Like in the Club Level at the UC.
OH, gotcha. Is that different than season tix?

Oh and btw it had nothing to do with Packers. The fact is bears and eagles fans are arguing about who has more Sb victories. ONLY 1 vs 0.
Only Super Bowls matter. Those games before are now NFC Championships.
The Packers only have 4 Super Bowls. Good job on the 6 horrible teams you faced before.

It hurts more that watching the Tucker years.
What was the response to your initial tweet? Apparently I'm blocked by someone I don't even know.
@ChicagoBears don't need to push the pocket on defense... Need to dismantle the pocket get thru fast and go get that qb..

How many rings does your QB have again?
So sorry about your grandfather. It is never easy Congrats on your wedding. Lots of luck and best wishes

@ChicagoBears Select Deshaun Watson at 3. No trading down and then trading back in the 1st round. Draft him at 3
Each of the heroes is crucial to creating the blend of analysis & entertainment present in each episode.It's offensive to grade them. #shame

hey leave the Bears' social media manager alone. There's a typo in every other tweet so he's obviously retarded.
I know nothing about Illinois sports but when did the @Cubs grow into the @ChicagoBears ????
So the @ChicagoBears want to make fun of my guy @AaronRodgers12 ? Why don't you go look at your 1 championship and we'll look at our 13!
See, I think you missed the whole, petty thing. I know The Bears suck, I don't care. It's the art of being petty. Sorry you responded.
So the @ChicagoBears even beat themselves when tweeting. Chi Trib tweet was funny. Sorry @AaronRodgers12 too soon for u tho sorry. Head up
what did it say? I missed it
I see the @ChicagoBears deleted a tweet. HA! Don't tweet shit if you can't handle the fallout #GoPackGo

they should have deleted that account after going 3-13.
3 Super Bowls in 50 years isn't helping your case. Referencing championships before WWII isn't helping either
So the @ChicagoBears tried to be funny and troll Aaron Rodgers but ended up getting owned by everyone so they deleted the tweet lmao.
I'll chill just stupid someone dumb enough to say that
He did tho

I'm not saying they haven't had good years - just not many. The Packers have competed with the Vikings and Lions much more past 10 years.

You don't hear that too often ... we know who likes losing
Yes dude is a stud but hopefully @TheAdams_era prevents those plays from ever happening against the @ChicagoBears again

@ChicagoBears tried to troll A-Rod today even though he is 14-4 against their pathetic franchise. Your QB is Mike Glennon by the way

You know, the funny thing is, they could use that tweet any day for any reason. Today it's just funnier than it would've been last week.
Ok, even as a @packers fan, acknowledging sharp trolling by @chigagotribune. But never forget that @AaronRodgers12 owns the @ChicagoBears pic.twitter.com/Mgbp4X3zRZ
BEARS CAN SUCK MY DITKA!
People are complaining about this tweet?
the same feeling each year you're not winning the division?

Unfollowing everyone who's butthurt about the @ChicagoBears Friday feeling tweet. Not that you'll care. #PullYourSkirtDown .
he'll throw for 9 in Green Bay just cuz he's Aaron Rodgers and he does what he wants
Aaron Rodgers owns your entire organisation. Pardon the pun, but are you really going to poke the bear?
Real low class there, is this your doing Virginia? Old ladies getting mean in her late years.
ICYMI @Packers won the NFC Championship in @ChicagoBears Soldier Field........ Maybe leave the baaaaaaaaad man alone.
Let me guess u have one of those useless pieces of paper that makes u think u matter
The @ChicagoBears have been handed a big fat L on almost every occasion when the play the Pack and this is what you do...? Poor choice. https:// twitter.com/zachheilprin/s tatus/850485342557925376 …
It's all in good fun
Well this is a dumb tweet i doubt any of us plays for the bears so he didnt take me down anywhere lol.........
Loving the fact they all keep playing that one clip. You wear cheese on your head end of
. @ChicagoBears all the packer fans are salty
@AaronRodgers12 @packers @ChicagoBears When you go 13-34 the last three years #FridayFeeling #Don 'tTalkAboutTheBest #KeepYourMouthShut
Never forget! pic.twitter.com/hWgCSiLQLg
It just shows what assholes are on the @ChicagoBears organization #noclass
Hakeem Nicks Laugh
@SarahSpain Why are @ChicagoBears poking the grizzly in the eye with a sharp stick? Sorry for happens next season
Hahahaha
Yea hes a douche though!
And listens to nickleback
I can't help but point out that both the @bears and @packers have beaten the @patriots in the #SuperBowl lol.
lmao he's gona kill yall next season.
that was sarcasm don't think I'm that stupid
I'm not mad. A-Rodge FFS he doesn't let anything go. John Fox will have someone fired over this lmao. Bears lose by 30 each game
It's the reason real writers have to present their work to HR when interviewed. To prevent bad "edgy" guy's probably an 18 year old intern
For the love of god don't poke the bear...
well that's why I called it a bold prediction. Rodgers vs Glennon gonna be a shootout
