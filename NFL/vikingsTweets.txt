@Vikings I'm happy we got sam as a place holder.. but we all no that sophomore that got the vikes the best record since Favre is the starter
@vikings sam about 6 years in, 3 different teams, 0 playoffs apperances, and multiple injuries..
Got excited then realized this was a @Vikings tweet and not a @HistoryVikings tweet https:// twitter.com/Andy_Benoit/st atus/851893366748925952 …
Ethan Cooper....pleeeeease.
He is, but many believe that he would be better suited to playing guard in the NFL.
I'll bet even @TheSlyStallone didn't know the apt address in #Rocky was 1818. I see it as for @Vikings #SuperBowl52 2/18/18 #NeverGiveUp

@Vikings My Draft Predictions: 48:Pat Elflein 79:Samaje Perine 86:Jaleen Johnson - Just guessing!

I'll agrue with anyone lol espiscally talking about the football
It's all good I don't like the Vikings. U went from arguing a random guy to me lol
Lol just stop with the excuses are divison is not that good we had to win like 5 in a row just to make the playoffs
He is the team
We have a good qb yes but we don't even have a top 10 defense a qb can only do so much there's a reason rodgers only have 1 ring
They played in a worse division. Only team they played was Tennessee
But that had a top 3 defense texans made the damn playoffs with oswelier and dolphins made it
lol I ain't trying to argue u it's just something u gotta remember they had no blockers lol
But the Vikings didn't have an mvp qb holding them up for half the year lol. Makes a difference

Excuses packers had 4th string cbs no running backs injured wr and lbs stop with the bs excuses vikings just suck enough said 2nd time

And we're also gonna ignore that he's struggled to win? Look at cutler, talents there, but he's simply not a winner
That team almost went to the superbowl. I think you're reaching a little much with the word "desperate"
I mean when we had literally any of our coaches we have now, that was a desperate team also
Shit that last one was Brett Favre.
That's the answer i was looking for. I know the truth, dudes point was obsolete tho.
McCaffrey will be a 3rd down back in the NFL, way overrated.
While big ben gets tagged with Rape numerous times and continuous to play.
Kap will get a gig eventually, but not with the Vikings. Who was the last high profile player the Vikings pursued? Nobody
Cus everyone you just named is white. Kaep isn't. That's why
It seems like you're creating excuses opposed to noting that the NFL is a racist organization. AP gets suspended for disciplining his child
Literally just explained that too you
and as for incognito, he proved that he can keep it under control and was basically kicked out of the league for 2 years
he got the 49er Job tho.
Again Johnny Manziel is more of a prospect than him, Richie incognito still in the league, Chip Kelly still coaching, yet Kaep gets the Axe
Chip Kelly isn't in the league anymore, he should have never gotten the 49ers job, but they were desperate, and dumb
we lost a lot and didn't gain much .. we need to kill it in the draft
They shouldn't a distraction because they're his rights, but they are, and that's simply the reality of the situation
Especially with chip kelly still coaching and Richie incognito still in the league.
noo we don't need a safety keep developing Kearse
Nah i just wanted to see what you identified as a distraction. Him not standing for the anthem nor his Castro comments should be that
Were you born yesterday? The whole not standing for the anthem, Castro comments, he's a walking story waiting to happen.
distraction how?
Kaep is a huge distraction, and Keemun was a decent backup until he had to play in that rams offense
they was better off getting Kap opposed to Keenum. He sucks
I also like Buddha Baker if he is still there for Safety-CB- Nickel = Depth
Depth at QB, probably means heinicke and or hill is gonna get cut unless they beat him out in training camp/preseason
This mean you guys are trading up?
I need answers on why Case Keenum was picked up? As a loyal fan, I'm disturbed.

Yeah.
That's the Texas Tech quarterback right?
Well according to many things I have seen no QB's are taken in first round till 20 or later!! doesn't make sense
I guess it would depend on how much they're willing to give up to trade up for him. No way they get him where they are now
I think the Patrick mahomes dude COULD be good but needs a Brady, manning, Big Ben, someone GOOD to learn from. We don't have that!!
I love him. Unless they are keeping it a secret they haven't talked about him at all . To me he will be the BOOM among BUSTS
Stupid voice text can't spell his name haha #fail
Deshawn watson
I think the Shawn Watson would be a fantastic pick for the Texans but I feel like they could still use a quarterback for the now
LOCK HIM UP VIKES!!
I want this guy right here!!!! @DeshaunWatson4 pic.twitter.com/TyQs3G2Wcq
For the right price I'd take a chance on cutler.. don't love him but not going to pay him huge. The Vikings or browns or jets can have Kaep
Cutler plays like favre. Take the good with the bad on him. Kaep should be a starter in this league.
Most talented yes but not best pick he wasn't there long enough in my opinion
Kaepernick absolutely not. Jay cutler if he was smart with his throws.... both are done in my opinion.
Both would make the Texans SB contenders.

The Vikings are A joke they always Will be mocked me but we have five rings.
sorry I didn't make it clear Randy Moss was only good on the Pats and it was bc of TB.
Then years later you fell asleep at the whelk and missed your pick
I would say the @Vikings have bigger needs. #Bradford & #Keenum should be serviceable behind better line. I think OL, DB, & RB are bigger.

@Vikings new facility looking huge. @PAOnTheMic Eagan is the new EP. Very hot. pic.twitter.com/ByoIc4yLyg
please retire @RandyMoss number. Its only right. Respect #84 !
deservedly so. He's the reason why we're still drafting receivers now in every draft
I would put him at number two with number one being Chuck Foreman who is still not in the Hall of Fame.
As he should have. Most dominant receiver ever. Ever.

All Day. His stats prove it.

Plenty of possibilities. @Vikings stadium at Eagan facility will have 6,000 seats, with capability of expanding to 10,000. Opens in 2018 https:// twitter.com/sorensen_andy/ status/850030702401908737 …
Interesting idea honestly. Could even do a Timberwolves Shootout style event Labor Day weekend.
Nothing against Randy, who was great. But this is an insult to Page, maybe greatest NFL Player of all time.
How much would the team get paid?

What is this guy trying to say? I feel like my brain was hurting from trying to decrypt this message...
to badsee don't have a first round pick
Ya to bad he won't fall anywhere near us.
That's fair. I'm just saying don't read too much into hints from Vikings, even if it IS from front office. #SKOL
It's not like we haven't done it before why is it so hard to believe?
Yes, because the Vikings scouts and coaching staff share strategy thoughts with the marketing team all the time
no @Vikings

"Great" hahahahaha

And in the 1995 draft I said the same thing about Warren Sapp but we passed on him. That still hurts.
Alô @Vikings @Vikings_Brazil já que abrimos mais de 10 milhões de salary cap com a saída do @AdrianPeterson , que tal pegar um playmaker?
we traded him like a dumbass for stone hands! Then wasted another pick getting him back later and then released him.
The 90s
Years later you traded him away and drafted Troy Williamson to replace him. Hahahahaha!!!

Point of the argument: you never know what next year will bring #skol
Pretty sure he's going to go for #7
People also said Trump wouldn't become president.
Who's not going to be playing in it? The Vikes.
Who's hosting the next Super Bowl?
Because your team sucks and I'm willing to remind you of that
Why did I know you would be the one to say something like that?
I like that
Because they have like NOTHING going for them right now, Spielman needs to go.
How many rings?
Love the attitude!
Skol
Wearing @Vikings socks in Madison, whoops
Your the only one that can wear #17 you will look way different in any other number #SKOL
Dam were gonna suck if teddy doesnt play

He's like #3 on the depth chart, what's he gonna do?
Hell yea. Name your price
Hell no I added your jersey to the collection last year
I'm well aware of that..hence why bother mentioning him when he's a first rd pic
No he can wear a different number

For the right price he can wear #17 too .
So did we release Hill? Did he retire?
Why are we talking this much about a backup QB?
Teddy already made a mark on my heart.

Well and why you have thrown a ball out of nowhere when WR are free
we don't have a first round pick anymore
Profound... how do you feel about scoring points?

If we do pick a running back let's not pick a Darren Nelson let's pick a Marcus Allen
Looks like I'm a Viking fan now!!!
awsome!
I was about to make a joke about Tony Romo retiring after not winning anything, then I remembered I'm a @Vikings fan #PeopleInGlassHouses
Super bowl confirmed
Why are the Vikings not interested in Tony Romo as 1st backup to Sam?

Pretty up there, bestly during the fall and spring. I used to live in Mankato, MN. The Viking practice somewhere around there.
in his defense i'd be negative too if i got deported from philly 2 @Vikings . then again this soda tax here is getting completely out of hand
Hope to see you all in London #when we find out the date
After breaking his neck...his effort and hands are off the chart!

You might ask for a different number on your jersey. 7 has NOT been a lucky number for this Organization.
Rams instantly got better.
LMAO
I wouldn't touch the no. 7 with a ten foot pole if I get on the @Vikings

But his arms are the same colour as his face!
It'd be a big adjustment going from a winning tradition of excellence to the dumpster fires that are the @ChicagoBears & @Vikings however.
@Vikings I don't see any free agent or trade targets what kind of signing is this? @OrlandoMagic
@casekeenum7 welcome to @Vikings #SKOL

Clemmings is the worst tackle ever to start a game for an NFL team though so technically it's an upgrade
Hot garbage
I got my T Jack jersey for 6 bucks at TJ Maxx
He is one of the worst RT in the league!
Welcome! #SKOL

I got my Randall Cunningham in mothballs...
or T Jack lol!
Time to get the Ponder Jersey out and put Keenum over it.
But but 7 was Ponder and T-Jack i thought for sure either would have retired jersey numbers by now and be on the ring of fame
New #Vikings jersey numbers: #4 Ryan Quigley #7 @casekeenum7
Nice. I will overlook the split infinitive. Good luck.
If this guy becomes a Viking, I guarantee @Vikings fans will fall in love with his personality and on field play. #SKOL #VOLS pic.twitter.com/KUypreAp9p
Did you guys forget about Teddy Bridgewater?? Smh #notmyQB
@NFL 2017. Los @Vikings contratan al P Ryan Quigley.
Both the @Vikings and the @Twins won their most recent home openers—and the #mnorch performed at each game. Coincidence? :)
Rodgers 05....you could argue Percy, Rhodes, Treadwell and Bridgewater. Genocide Smith as well
Andre smith didn't even play
the @twins on pace to go 162-0 and the @vikings are gonna make a ridic offer for @tonyromo now that he's retired amirite @joey_joeeeey
Congrats! Vikings > Rams
Yup. Patterson/ Floyd fell hard.
My heart flutters because of this
Good luck case
Que no se vaya que vaya a lo @Vikings ahí lo hacemos jugar y brillar
NO. OFFENSIVE LINE.
Ur a disease
A little foreshadowing?
Ok, @Vikings stop messing around and offer Romo a deal he can't turn down.

They share information on any prospect not just ones they have a chance at. Plus you don't know what will happen draft night.
1st round pick..shouldn't we focus on protecting Bradford
Yeah like the Vikings have a shot 2 get him so what your point ?

I think he's poised to have another very good season. He'll have a better O-line & run game this season around him which will help
Forman should be a strong consideration. Power runner is what Zimmer wants
First off the only person that didn't suck last year was Caption. The rest were less than average. AP is done
Joss Whedon going to @DCComics & @wbpictures feels like when @Favre4Official went to @Vikings . See! Sports & geekdom can coexist!
Why?
#htowntakeover #gocoogs congrats Case show em what you got
@VikingGraphics need some graphics of case
Why not? Let's let him know he sucks!

All he does is Win.
One can only hope; it was a devastating injury
Good for him I truly hope he makes a comeback
