#AskMalcolm as you know, oak is leaving for vegas in a few years, what was it like playing for the @RAIDERS in front of the blackhole?
@icecube I thought you stopped giving juice to the @raiders . Cuz Al Davis never paid you. And he needs a bulletproof vest. Remember?
@_NativeRaider_ @RAIDERS @thebig3 @AmyTrask Things just got a whole lot better...go get'em Amy!!!
take the L you were wrong Mark is going to make a killing in Vegas while you Recording podcasts in a tiny condo with not a woman in sight
Oh so I guess it's ok for cube to talk out about the Raiders but the Oakland fans can't?
False news story to give the @Seahawks leverage. Spread #rumor he could go to any team, less likely to simply release for @RAIDERS #raiders
Lmao I feel for you
Hahaha a business dispute? Dispute with who?
Oh most definitely
I could tell this probably happened to you lol
Naw. I've been exposing him. He needs to come correct about it. Dont give him an excuse or pass. He did do 30 for 30 since. No pass 4 him
Young and dumb, he prob would come correct now by saying he voiced a business dispute....
Hmmmm seems like the exact same process with the Bank of America Loan but ya what's reality got 2 do with the crap u say
And he also said Al Davis needs a bulletproof vest.
Yep yep!!!! Nobody calls him on it. Tag @raiders and others. He needs to be exposed.
I'm dead @RAIDERS pic.twitter.com/oK94p2GQ0S
You talking about @IceCube saying, "He stopped Giving Juice to the Raiders cuz Al Davis Never Paid Us?"
@RAIDERS y'all taking notes or nah https:// twitter.com/athletics/stat us/851851502045904896 …
Did the A's get there rent increased 3 times like MD and the Raiders?
@JamesConner_ running style is like lynch shouldn't the @RAIDERS look to add a younger player in the draft? #beastmode
Hey if yall dont believe me heres a link to @icecube the wrong nigga to eff with. He stopped giving juice 2 da R8ers https:// youtu.be/lydlE9y25BY
It wasn't the A's that screwed the Raiders. Try digging a little deeper and getting your facts straight before you want to troll my tweets.

I'd argue - like many would he's too poor to own it in Vegas as well. Remind me of Frank McCourt. Gonna be tough
I think Davis is going to make serious revenue. Time will tell though John. Won't know for a decade at least if this was right or wrong call
Haha, jed is a squirrel that ruined a great team by letting harbaugh telling him to f- - k off and letting baalke run the team..ignorance
Wishing good luck to #SanJoseState WR/KR @Tim_Crawley for upcoming workouts with @49ers and @RAIDERS ! #SJSU #NFL #NFLDraft #PathToTheDraft
All the events would still go to Levi/AT&T. No way BofA would lend Davis 500m-1B for a stadium that host 10-12 events a year
Who's saying he'll even make revenue? He owes a billion in a tiny little market
I'm not him.
There is way too many new stadiums in the Bay Area for Davis to have a stand alone cheap stadium. Won't make revenue like he would in LV
Rock and Roll Jalen bring it man!
So, its my birthday today & no new @RAIDERS or Beast-Mode news. Worst birthday ever! @derekcarrqb you have any news might cheer me up?

@RAIDERS https:// twitter.com/bleacherreport /status/851895133910036483 …
@Raiders I expect RM to take the top player at a position that costs the most to sign as FA. Not LB, RB, TE unless a stud drops. I say DB
And Mark couldn't get it Done in the Bay Area. Jed did. Why one guy is rich and the other is broke
she gets my vote!
Jed has more money is his couch than Mark, raiders make no money. I'm sorry my man
You have said Jed runs laps around Mark in terms of business well Mark just got almost 1 billion of tax payer money for his stadium so....
Jalen Richard was one hell of an unstaffed find. More like him please Reggie
@RAIDERS ... https:// twitter.com/BleacherReport /status/851895133910036483 …
Do your thing @RAIDERS https:// twitter.com/bleacherreport /status/851895133910036483 …
Way to keep in the #RaiderNation @icecube
Jed cut the same deal too get his stadium but the @raiders are run by the @NFL & Jerry. That's some sound logic
@RAIDERS if RM didn't give 4.5$ to Brown that's around what or less than what an unproven first Rd player will get.
I think it’s safe to say he’s definitely qualified to be on the @RAIDERS https:// twitter.com/TMZ/status/851 890620515762176 …
Super Excited to see what are a great GM does, so glad he passes on giving $$$ to Brown and Poe. Don't expect LB in first though because

@RAIDERS hire @MoneyLynch

Wow! What a great hire!
If u can get Jordan / Pippen / Rodman on it I'll be watching . Kobe / Shaq / Fisher big ratings imo .make it happen
Don't understand why the @Raiders refuse to do so, with a waitlist for season tickets.
no doubt. Would be shocking but not impossible.
Will the @RAIDERS do the same for this upcoming season?
Weren't u a CEO with the Raiders before
You got the right person Cube. AL would approve

Thank you very much - much appreciated - and, hi.
NFL owners suck. All billionaires and want new stadiums funded by tax payers. Bunch of bullshit
Agreed.
Still doesn't make sense seeing as how the A's never sell out anyway
Here's hoping
Carr exemplefies what the model player of NFL should act like and, is high candidate to replace Brady as face of NFL when he hangs it up.
Thank you - and, hi.
Awwww damn...no!!
Who?

The tarps on Mt. Davis are staying. It's just the ones in the upper deck around the field.
So the tarps are coming off for A's games, but Mt. Davis was unsafe for @RAIDERS games? OK
Kansas City taxpayers contributed 212 million to renovate arrowhead stadium. How much has Oakland put forward?
exactly right, I'm with ya
But I thought the @Raiders said it's too expensive to remove the tarps? What a joke. Can you @Raiders leave ASAP
$ Free .95? I'm there. Lol.
Who?
I'm a Raiders fan for life so yes I will def go to reg season games in Vegas but paying for pre season games is a no go for me
Awesome. Congrats @AmyTrask

Donald, you should be worried. In Vegas, everything about the Raiders will change - and change for the worse.
Alright bet

Hey GK. Do you know when they put dates/times to TBD?

Deserves? There is no such obligation. And most probably will. They are dependent on the hand that feeds, no matter that hand.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY COACH HAVE A GREAT DAY
But hey,to each their own. Im sure people in Oak, including Bay Area media members,will treat the LVRJ reporter with the respect he deserves
And to think that they and their purpose here is welcome, is naive by you at best. More likely, out of touch and/or self serving.
None of the people we are speaking on are the #Raiders org or NFL. Talking about an out of town reporter/media, fan reaction & the city.
Couth is something not in the realm of the Raiders organization or NFL business execution. Your projecting of it will not make it so.
O Philadelphia @Eagles assinou por um ano com o QB Matt McGloin, ex- @RAIDERS .
Its a justification for having couth & perspective. What, do you think the city is going to outlaw anything & everything Las Vegas?
What a joke. @nflcommish @raiders https:// twitter.com/rapsheet/statu s/851456831205650432 …

Fact that you're trying to justify this by the $20 he's going to drop on lunch now and then is kind of funny
Because its just sports & most people running the city aren't fan boys? The city & restaurants & hotels will gladly have Michael's $$
No. Why do we want anything about Las Vegas in our community?

It's exploitation and the joke of a team shouldeave now.

#Raiders
The Raiders are moving to Vegas, of course they are going to start covering the team and set up media. It is what it is.
They are sending writers to do a job. They are also sending money into the Bay Area by doing so.

Dear @chickmcgee1 , I smokes the best Sweet Leaf after Drumming and hanging out with a @RAIDERS fan. #GodBlessAmerica
In reality you that say you are fine with the RAIDERS are still here, why?
Why dodo you still tweet about the team if you're no longer a fan, you were screaming Vegas should be using that 750ML on education!!
Lol, yea that great winning percentage in Oakland....some of you guys don't know anything.

I'm a diehard Raiders fan, but I support my hometown Philadelphia Eagles as my 2nd team.
I believe you're allowed to be a fan of (2) teams in each sport. Your hometown team & the team you genuinely like. Philly is my 2nd team
I've supported the @RAIDERS for awhile now.. But I will be rooting for them more.. So now y'all will know when you see my posts
PSA: I AM A @Saints fan regardless of win, lose, or draw.. I will remain a @Saints fan but I will also b on the @RAIDERS bandwagon too
Hey @RAIDERS my friend @QTyler_Wardlaw & I are wondering if we can get a new Las Vegas Raiders t-shirt? I'm a L and he's an XL #JustWinBaby

THE A's
. @greenday were mostly mild-mannered when it came to topic of the @raiders , acknowledging the move w/o putting #Vegas down. Then... (1/2) https:// twitter.com/effinstephan/s tatus/851225272292593664 …
Should the @RAIDERS move up to get S Jabrill Peppers of #Michigan in the #NFLDraft ?
Arm wrestling is going to be the reason why the @RAIDERS dont move to Vegas and im fucking loving it
Just a little bit, not too much.
The @Lakers ending the season like the @RAIDERS did the season before they went 12-4 Might be a sign #Icantellthefuture
#Raiders
#Raiders
Yeah, the fun begins
Wait the @NFL can OK moving the @RAIDERS to @Vegas but the players can't arm wrestle there? #Hypocritical http://www. espn.com/nfl/story/_/id /19118471/nfl-look-pro-football-arm-wrestling-championship-possible-violations …
I mean on the show specifically.
How much Mandarin do you speak?
#BRUUUUUUUUUUCE . Miss ya mane. Glad ya enjoying the @Raiders .

Well said. The new stadium is $ 4 nfl+owners. It hurts the teams chances of winning, which is all I cared about. @raiders #soldout

A Charity event and the @NFL wants to fine them or worse. They did not gamble and it is for a good cause @Borsilli @RapSheet @RAIDERS
@RAIDERS Ishmael Zamor's beating of his dog is disgusting abuse of an animal. No excuse to even consider him playing in the @NFL . #PETA
@RAIDERS my dog is a huge Raiders fan pic.twitter.com/hnOdAY6wTr
@Raiders have drafted 12 players from @seniorbowl in Reggie McKenzie Era Most notable Derek Carr,Gabe Jackson,McGill,D Washington, J. Ellis
Awesome to see the guy win after all the years of trying! Now I just need my @RAIDERS to win a SB so I can feel the same joy!
Hey it sounds pretty reasonable to me
Hahaha omg. Please stay away from Vegas. We don't want you any where near.
Lol this guy.,.
Lol
Haha good
Have to earn respect to receive respect. Give me 11-5, AFC South Champs, and the 3rd seed in the AFC playoff picture this season! #BelieveMe
Hey @NFL , the @MGMGrand is only a short walk from where @RAIDERS will play. Good luck! https:// twitter.com/SportsCenter/s tatus/851134176342495233 …

Just about the only team from Oakland. @RAIDERS fans say hello to Vegas. LOL. Now back to the sport that really matters GO #RipCity
The Raiders are not going to have any home-field advantage in LV because tickets are going to be sold to a mixture of fans who visiting
I totally agree with you.
@NFL to @RAIDERS : move to Vegas? No problem! #NFL to players: goto Vegas for an arm wrestling competition? Suspended! #NFLLogic
I TOTALLY AGREE....DESTROYING THE ESSENCE OF @RAIDERS HISTORY ALSO KILLING LONG TIME SEASON TICKET HOLDERS

Economist says Las Vegas @RAIDERS stadium deal "worst ever" for a city. http:// read.bi/2n1WEkq @Mark_J_Perry #LostWages

This is just the beginning of the trouble Raiders will get in. Way to choose money over fans @RAIDERS @NFL . SMH. We got 1 season to get it
Just wait till players and coaches get in trouble the @NFL @nflcommish you made a huge mistake

Cause the A's are awesome !
Risk by having fun? I'm glad he's not beating women, promoting violence, or being a stuckup celebrity...need more athletes like this
I don't forget they are human. I just couldn't imagine doing anything to risk the dream of the NFL worked so hard for.
Lmaooo it's funny y'all forgot these are human beings, football is just a game . Life is short. LIVE IT UP .
Titans are a scary team that deserve more respect... We ran a poll on that a few months ago #TITANUP
Because the Traitors are trash. One playoff appearance in like 10 years. You act like the Traitors were this juggernaut of a team.
I hate him.
Why did Oakland choose you over the @RAIDERS
