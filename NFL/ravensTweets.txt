@_tonyjefferson is really apart of #BalGang Great season to come @Ravens
barnett is a game changer. He reminds me a lot of Suggs.
Means that If he is there and M.Williams is not he would be a great pick
So this means what?
Thanks!
Hawks are gone but other 3 are open. Plz text 55305 with full name, DOB, phone #of the 4 of you and 1 new team for Jeff

@Ravens U already know...And I'm on BOARD. ..FULL FLEDGE
Thats a fact
if you add @Justdatguy29 @TheUnoShow1 in this years draft there'll be a damn good chance

best safety duo in league, when 22 is healthy he's a great player, tavon is a stud, Carr brings durability and add a rookie or 2
On paper, yes.. Definitely. We have the talent. Now the guys gotta show it.

Yeah there are a couple of schools we haven't took a player from
I want Barnett, Reddick, M.Williams or C.Davis at 16.
that's the issue. You know we havent drafted a player from LSU ever? They have had better NFL talent over the years too.
He's from bama
Peppers had 1 his whole college carrer He is highly ovveratted a glorified return guy all he is
I also hate the cam robinson situation. Ozzie saying hes the best tackle in the draft is sheer stupidity.
well matt elams ''interceptions'' at florida were basically gimmies that just got deflected and hit him in the chest.
He might not even be Elam I think Matt had better numbers than peppers
@Ravens sign @AdrianPeterson
Peppers ? You mean Corey Davis ?
Oh hell nooo bad enough we brought webb back

Please don't draft Peppers..... @Ravens
Not in the 1st round....or the 2nd
lol we have nothing to give the seahawks. We can just draft a CB this year anyways
Mangold and Boldin yes, Peppers absolutely no. Peppers is not a LB and we already have Jefferson Weddle & Webb
@Ravens make it happen ... please?!?!?!?!?!? #ravens https:// twitter.com/Ravens/status/ 851836670467067905 …
Peppers? That's a funny way of spelling Davis.
Boldin
I'm okay with getting Fournette @Ravens just don't trade up for him.. trade up for a dam WR!!
BRING Q BACK PLEASE!!!!
Why not all 3 of them
no to peppers a millions times over. He's matt elam 2.0..just a bit more athletic...
I swear if Baltimore drafts Peppers I'm gonna lose my mind
literally everyone questioning this move is dumb as a box of rocks.
. @BmoreEisenberg : It wouldn't be surprising to see Mangold, Peppers or Boldin in purple and black next year. : http:// rvns.co/72z pic.twitter.com/q6CB5Kcezp

This would be a dream come true and that would instantly make my Ravens a team you don't want to throw it on
I think he would fit the personality of the team from a few years ago. Probably not a good scheme fit, and can't afford it I imagine.

Wow our secondary is about to be crazy!! @Ravens
I like this, as long as it wasn't too expensive. He'd be a good mentor for the new young talent coming our way
EVERY team in the NFL would be interested in him. But Ravens aren't willing to spend that much money and he's not going anywhere, anyway.
https:// youtu.be/Fam3ZeNU_as @ravens joe yearby aka juice. Kid is a beast ......
Our corners are solid now, plus hes tok expensive and seattle want lot from him. No thanks
We have Carr, Smith, Webb, Jefferson, Young who all can play corners. No we do not need him. Cost too much to trade plus we add more in draf
he better be playing corner because he is no good at safety

If he makes us better he fits the "Ravens culture" but it's pretty mute because this won't happen
No he's a cancer
For those questioning this signing just stop. He's a good third safety and an experienced corner who can help the young guys.
Welcome home, Webby! #RavensFlock : http:// rvns.co/72x pic.twitter.com/J2jUjBZQen
Hell no
@kpotter91 send them howies
Makes sense he will be on a league minimum great back up option can be a mentor to younger players and retire a raven #RavensFlock
Why though? lol
Noooooo
Man i would love to see him in a Ravens uniform. Can't remember the last time we had a shut down corner
Should had the Steelers in preseason
Why not just keep him on the bench now and draft a CB or SS that he can groom up, I don't get this move
no im not seeing that, people talking about his character. He 10xs upgrade from carr. would love to take him on roster
I don't agree with this move. Why just why
Why ? Just why?
No thank you

Weddle costs us 4 games. Raiders dropped pick, Trip young vs, giants, blown coverage on hogan, trucked by A brown. Webb gets ripped tho.
Already has his number back, Jefferson is #23
No, but a true number 1 corner would be interesting.
Hope he does better
Jefferson all ready gave it back

Interested but you need to give up someone average that doesn't get as much playing time
Ravens def. is good enough
We need offense. Jesus take the wheel
jesus fucking christ no.
NO
Please no!?
Yeah that's true. It would just be nice to have him back there with our guys
Insufficient funds.

No. Does not fit the culture. Ravens are humble creatures.
Don't do it ain't worth it bro let him stay with them we need young corners we already resigned Webb @Ravens https:// twitter.com/ravens/status/ 851787974492782593 …

Check out @Ravens 's Tweet: https:// twitter.com/Ravens/status/ 851540620032266245 …
I can NOT wait!!!!!!
And if there please make it happen or I will be upset.
Can you pls work some magic and make more London tickets appear? Do you know how hard I’ve been working my fam for this???
NOLA again? Lol
We always end the preseason against the Saints
@Redskins hey big head
Mark your calendars. The preseason schedule has arrived. : http:// rvns.co/72t pic.twitter.com/8tJwyFxQHH
@Ravens . If Urschel isn't starting at center, should Hurst and Jensen should go because he would be a swing guard/center? #RavensMailbag
@Ravens I was watching my favorite English team get slaughtered and I noticed you have a fan in the crowd! pic.twitter.com/7gHQQQDWmd
@Ravens . Should the Ravens go heavier for offense in the earlier rounds since it's a defensive draft this year? #RavensMailbag
@Ravens PLEASE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! https:// twitter.com/thescorenfl/st atus/851529762438656000 …
thats the one i saw in person..no effort..just breaks away from everyone..my dream is a davis perriman duo but i'll just keep praying
Healthy it would be an awesome pick
A lot of our fans think hes a 1 trick pony cause he's fast but don't realize he's a great route runner and has good hands. if he can stay
Like his run against MIA, looked like he was jogging til u realize everyone else was sprinting full force and still couldn't keep up lol
into our 1..but with those hands he has a ways to go...too much upside..in person dude flies and u dont even realize it lmao.
me personally i wouldnt mind ross. other fans dont want him beacuse we have enough speedsters and i understand..i just want BP to develop
I do agree with you, just not at 5. John Ross is the most realistic WR option for us
Far too many holes to trade up I say; sit tight & go BPA at 16 or trade back a little if possible & secure additional picks
Former CSFB trustee Luke Cooper's new firm @fixthq awarded huge advertising contract with the @Ravens . Congrats! https:// technical.ly/baltimore/2017 /04/07/fixt-ravens-pitch-competition/ …
i dont see davis or williams getting pass tenn or arizona..especially with tenn losing out on alshon and fitz retiring soon..we'd be lucky
Your BIGGEST Redskin Fan In @Ravens ! pic.twitter.com/QRraivt0T3
I highly doubt any receiver goes at 5, that'd be a reach. Especially considering Jamal Adams,Hooker and Lattimore will probably all be there
1st brothers in NFL history to serve as head coaches. #NationalSiblingsDay @CoachJim4UM @49ers @Ravens http:// on.nfl.com/y8Yxfc
Please define each College Scout and their territory responsibility?
Probably the coldest take ever. Two literal HoF and close to, if not THE, best at their positions EVER!
Great news. Really hope the @Jaguars vs @Ravens will be similar time as my children are coming to that one & it's not school hols?!
No a ton of WR needy teams ahead of us. My guess is Buffalo takes Williams and there's a decent chance Davis falls to us
What are the chances we trade back for Cam Robinson in the first round. Ozzie loves picks and Alabama a lot... #RavensMailbag
There is a decent chance he will be there at 16, no huge need to trade up
Plz Ozzie!! Him or Mike!! @Ravens https:// twitter.com/ravens/status/ 851509839565946880 …
PLEASE he's #1 on my wishlist
trade up for him then
Corey Davis is regarded by some analysts as the best WR in the class, and he has all the makings of a No. 1 wideout: http:// rvns.co/72s pic.twitter.com/5NqKsmuCbC

Can they play wide receiver?

Just when your nfl team looks like family, the owners quickly remind us it's only a business. @ravens fans will miss you @TimmyJernigan93
Impressively bad take
The trade needed to happen. Moving up gave us ammo to move up in the first or second round. It was the right decision.
Saints really want Barnett, but I'd love to have him. I still think Davis is the most likely pick.
let's see..i think barnett might slide and we should take him.
unless de costa was playing mind games he didn't seem too high on corey davis and amped up m.williams and j,ross. those 2 met with ravens.
Then take a pass rusher
Can I announce this years first round draft pick?? If not first I'm available rounds 2-7 also #RavensMailbag
I really hope that does not happen i will be super pissed
Only if Corey Davis is gone. IMO
@Ravens @nfldraftscout @jamisonhensley @NFL stuck between J. Reeves-Maybin, D. Donahue, and J. Brown (UCLA) in RD 6 but #BestMockYet pic.twitter.com/EDyHYhOAfT
Track record shows they are good at getting OL in later rounds, especially at RT position, Wagner being latest proof

Best indoor soccer team of USA and Mexico !!!!!
Who are the other FAs we are targeting, how much cap space do we have left?? Is there a possibility of going defense with the 16th pick?
He was one of my favorites
ask them why they refused to give up stadium after ravens won the SB, ask last time they won everything
Birds of a feather... https:// twitter.com/_tonyjefferson /status/851457232617304065 …
To me the gold teeth say it all. He just doesn't seem to fit the "Play like a Raven" mold. Off field trouble and or poor production=future.
Post free agency mock draft? #RavensMailbag
Why haven't we added any necessary weapons to the offense?
Will the Ravens consider trading the 16th overall pick of the draft? @Ravens #RavensMailbag
What happened with Nick Mangold? He seemed like the perfect fit, a proven veteran that wouldn't cost a compensatory pick.

Njoku stupid fire. My dream wishlist is Corey Davis ryan anderson and akhello weatherspoon
Lattimore is insane.
I like Njoku he can block
Well its either him Conley or Moreau
Njoku would be like a new delanie.
Marshon knees been through hell and that scares me
I know lol, wishful thinking tho. We'll probably get a safety
I see y'all taking OJ and marshon
Doubt y'all go double offense like that lol
If we get OJ and Corey Davis all will be great in my world
No lie I seen a mock that had us going jabrill then Cooper kupp in 1&2 and I was HOT.
Just fav my tweet and holla at me when y'all go defense first round and draft a bum wr second round lol
Of course he does gay niggas good at catching balls nh
LMFAO
Odell got more yards than your whole wr core does combined by himself the last 3 years combined.
Odell so deep in the closet him and Jarvis finding Christmas presents.
Eli already got a concussion knowing Fluker and Flowers his left and right tackles
Too bad y'all drafting a DT
will he make it to Seahawks at 26?
Shut up
Get ready we're going on our Superbowl run #Ravensflock #RavensNation trueravenfansonly @ravens https://www. instagram.com/p/BSrL8PoFqn1/

Looks like @Ravens Poe took a "Road Trip" to the @KeySchool @annapolisbook pic.twitter.com/mkBAriXXYl
him paired with Mike Wallace is the equivalent to Odell and Marshall, or D jax and Evans. offensive nightmare for secondaries
If both are available please take Corey Davis. His upside is unreal
yes please
Pick him please
If you didn't know that you live under a rock
trade up for him then

Corey Davis makes the most sense for the @Ravens . Then Mike Williams. John Ross has speed but the Ravens need a possession receiver.
@Ravens have had far too many recent misses & have far too many holes to wait on recoveries IMHO
Anquan Boldin, YES PLEASE, as fans do we need to say anything else?
I totally forgot he was on the roster tbh

lmaaooooo
i'd rather go all Defense in this draft and make it the most dominant in the NFL and then focus on the O next year.This is a rebuilding year
@Ravens pic.twitter.com/VuocWtrIuy
The man built 2 SB winning teams.. He knows how to get what he needs at the WR position, period. #inozziewetrust
If we trade up we can get mike Williams prob will happen only if we don't go for john ross
We should get him especially along side tony Jefferson
i just dont see it personally. I want Mike Williams or Derek Barnett at 16 this year. Or Reddick.
Every player is different so don't just compare what happen to other people. Like he said he missed a year
We want him, but do we really NEED him? We only have 1 pick. #NFLDraft
@Ravens y'all need to get Sherman..if we can get bruh dat would solidify da db core and we won't have to work da draft so much for dbs
so did mark clayton..so did travis taylor.. i didnt like perriman as a pick in 2015..weak hands..poor routes etc
Perriman is not a bust, he missed 1 year with injury and slowed flashes last season. This is his prove-it year.

@JabrillPeppers Oh this be my wish come true you in #Ravens purple !!!
1 interception in his entire college career and has poor play recognition. Basicallly he's a more athletic and versatile matt elam.no thanks
when will this FO learn..Matt Elam...Breshad Perriman..and now potentially peppers?
What position would he play that we need and can't be filled with a position specific player? Brotherly favoritism
What!? Me too
uurrr 1 interception? Poor play recognition..NO ...
Well I'd hope so, he was his coach at Michigan
like it!! Weapons on d go early, plus I think cooper Kupp is the WR we need

Ravens haven't drafted a pro bowl receiver. Or any good WRs. He's saying that'll be his last feat.
Do you think Mixon is on the Ravens board? Even after the signing of Carr is CB still a priority in this years draft?
huh? He didn't draft Steve Smith Sr. Or what Pro Bowl receiver is he talking about?
You better draft Corey Davis!

Agreed.
Great story, but the photo would have been better with a @Ravens hat.
Gets hurt. And he's coming back on a bargain deal.
Exactly...he's a corner that was converted to safety and was #16 amongst all safties last year. He's a great option if a corner or safety

why would you bring webb back unless hes going to play corner ?
@MikeCamp_12 I was excited when the @Ravens drafted you. Glad you're back! Fam is rooting for you to do big things #RavensFlock
I don't mind but at the end of the day the best way to call out is to be great..and I haven't seen it. Even in college he was inconsistent.

Ravens did ass Anquan out of a contract. I don't blame him
Don't think they will or should sign Boldin, I am still hopefull for a high draft pass catcher.
Hey now, he's very good at watching receivers catch the ball right in front of him.
Webb is washed unfortunately veteran minimum maybe
Why did we get rid of Webb just to bring him back??? @ravens

This list is dumb. The @Ravens needed a quarter back not an offensive linemen.
@Ravens Might need Ravens owner to purchase the Wizards
you and I got different ideas about what NFL playmakers do fam.
I feel like we could probably sneak rice late is all. 3rd round possibly. All depends.
Paying him close to nothing and when active is a playmaker. Definitely worth the low cost
Yeah you might not know this but wide receivers catch the ball, not run the ball. Not sure how that's surprising...

Stop hating, he's a good special teams player, and he is a even better receiver and End around runner
He is a beast... have u watched a game with him in? The little guy that does End Arounds? He has scored a few TDs for us...
Shouldn't have wasted a dime on this dude
5 touches in 5 yrs and the excuse is he's a receiver?

@JohnCUrschel "Math has taught me perseverance and that has helped me in my other job" @Ravens #NCTMannual Thanks for flipping the script!
My favorite @Ravens player! So jealous!! #mdlearns #SDlearns

I'd think we smart enough to not do that. But hell, I've been surprised before.
Hey #NCTMannual Need to welcome @johncurschel with seven nations army chant. @ravens
"There is nothing wrong with telling young people to dream." @MIT Ph.D. candidate & #NFL @Ravens Offensive Lineman@JohnCUrschel #NCTMannual
cause we don't know how Smith is going to be. Could be another injury this year.
Suggs and Judon are the edge rushers. Cornerback is a must either 1st or 2nd. Carr is solid but we need depth.
yeah we're going to pick some injury prone lineman in the first round, I hate our first round picks
"The math that we were doing in school felt disconnected from real life." @MIT Ph.D. candidate & #NFL @Ravens OL @JohnCUrschel #NCTMannual
nah. We can get DE 5/6 round. We have Urban and Kaufusi. Plus we run 3-4. Both r solid. It's not that big of a position.
welcome back and stay healthy!
IM LEARNING TOWARDS reuben foster if they can't get 2 of the top receivers. Don't trust ross and he is another speed WR, they need a dog
Matching shoes
Nah. WR/DE

Thanks Bro...SALUTE
Yeah, Zrebiec himself posted that tweet after mangold left yesterday. There's interest, just a matter of working things out I guess
Thx 4 tha info homie
See I knew something has to be going on...Mangold wants to WIN...Work your magic Oz....
It's been reported both sides are interested even though he left
YeaaaYuh #RavensFlock @Ravens https:// twitter.com/MikeCamp_12/st atus/850078003887575043 …
BTW he's neither. He's a decoration on the trainers table. Round my way we just call him "IR"
Good signing, versatile special teamer and shown ability when on the field as reciever
Reports say the @Ravens have traded Timmy Jernigan to the Eagles. Dline is stacked but man he is a talented player
@Ravens show the doubters what's up bro
That's awesome. Enjoy!
Grrrrrrrr. ..I think he's still exploring options...Fuckkkk. ..Come on Oz..Make it happen
Frees up cap space. Btw he's a receiver and special teams player so that explains the lack of touches.
Cap space & he's currently our #1 PR as well as probably our WR3
Can the Ravens just use Camp like the patriots do with Edleman
Great news!
But mangold left Baltimore without an offer! Probably he didn't get enough money
Tonight, @LoopleMobile will pitch in the @Ravens Innovation Challenge at @lightcitylabs
I concur. .TRUST ME. ..It all starts in the TRENCHES. ..PERIOD...I think Oz is still after him!!!
Big brother and little sister trip! Ravens out in @DisneylandToday @Disneyland @Ravens pic.twitter.com/HQiUDqtTkO
Shoring up the special teams!!!
Guy has 5 touches in the last 5 years. A head scratcher, tbh.
We need starters OL! Yanda, Lewis, Stanley, no center, no RL! They can't even protect Joe Flacco even his leg!
WR Michael Campanaro announces via Instagram that he is re-signing with @Ravens . #ravens
We didn't sign him to thay big of a contract. ..1 yr deal...Can still get Mangold. .Come on Oz
@ElliottThorne
Lol
WTF?!?! I WANT MANGOLD!
I'd love to see what Camp can do with a healthy year
Why?
We have signed WR @MikeCamp_12 to a new one-year contract: http:// rvns.co/72f pic.twitter.com/x2wI3zkrJ6

@jamisonhensley What are the chances the @Ravens will go after Richard Sherman?
Talk of trading @RSherman_25 is silly, but while we're at it: come to the @Ravens ! All the crab cakes you can eat! How could u resist? :-)
Why @Ravens
Ed Reed with Deion will forever be the deepest backs we had, but I have faith that this one will be the greatest

@Ravens pick Chad Ochocinco up at CB please .
@Eagles acquired Timmy Jernigan from the @Ravens . Find out more about this trade at http:// sports-scoop.com .
Great photo either way
Yeah and it was my 2nd year...
Running game
That was after 15++ years in the league
Take one of those thirds and trade up to early second and grab him then
Exactly

@AnquanBoldin sign with the @Ravens !!!
he won't make it out of 2nd round but if he's there at 47 I would take him 100 times out of 100. Best corner in draft before injury
If he's available in the later rounds take him
Corey Davis all day
Still would love to see Ravens be able to grab him, 74 or 78th pick
You guys better hope you draft him. The kid is a stud

TODAY: Former @Ravens player @Obafemi30 ( #EMBA '16) will speak at the #HarborEast campus at 4:45 pm. RSVP: http:// bit.ly/2p1zeIk pic.twitter.com/HyuASV1zjd
Shut down the top players and have faith the rest of your teammates can handle the load? Sounds like team sports to me. #respectthetalent
if y'all niggas draft him in the first round i'm done
grab him in the 2nd
What? Yes it will
Eric DeCosta doesn't believe that the torn Achilles for CB Sidney Jones will hurt his draft stock too much: http:// rvns.co/72d pic.twitter.com/lHS4DpdtRn
5-11*
Except Jimmy played every game 2 years ago and we still went 5-1

Would you think they would be interested in him after may 9 if he still available?
He's an unrestricted free agent and would count against Ravens' comp picks if signed before May 9
@jamisonhensley why haven't the @ravens been interested in Austin Pasztor he is a solid player and can play right tackle and guard and young
my guy Tavon Young will develop nicely even more as well. Gonna be huge for us for years to come
He's one of the most loyal players we've had. I think the salary cap is spun in a way that has some fans hate players for getting paid.
In 15 gms vs @Ravens , playoffs included, 1032 yrds. Or 68.8 yds/gm average. Not bad but I'd call that contained for his level of talent.
Get Mangold not Webb!
Tabor!

YEAH DO THAT, BUT GEEZ, I'M WANTING A BIG LENNY AND K'DIX RB TANDEM. TAKE BACK THE NORTH https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=7MKKnC z8OSc …
A Cornerback better be our first or second rounder.
@Ravens really? Ladarius Webb? Don't get it one bit
@Ravens ummmmm.... we not looking anymore? https:// twitter.com/AroundTheNFL/s tatus/850009455383203841 …
Don't "believe" Do
Looking forward to some home cooking w/ @Ravens @JohnCUrschel at the #nctmannual . If he presents as well as he plays we are in for a treat!
It's Richard Sherman
Ozzie lost his touch
You better. Jimmy Smith injuries have killed our playoff chances last 2 years.
O-line doooe

Pick up Mangold, he's the greatest
I don't get hating guys like Webb who play hurt all the time.
@Ravens we need CB help trade for @RSherman_25 sigh @Revis24
Everyone bitches but secondary depth has been a huge weakness these past few years.. it's a passing league. Can't have enough quality DB's.
