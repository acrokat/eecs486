Reuben foster for the Bengals. And McCaffrey for Den. Thought this gave a link to my mock but it doesn't haha. Who do you want for bengals?
Or just work on catching & focusing, since that has been horrible the past two seasons. At least he's paid like the best WR in the NFL.

Bronco Defense was way good last year & Offense had huge yardage but didn't translate into TDs. So time will tell. @Broncos
Sounds like a plan to me!
lol I'm a Jets fan I wish my team had the broncos struggles bringing in other RB will make Anderson better
Not so much. I like Anderson (he's our best RB) but I think we've seen what he is. Inconsistent. I'd like to scrap them all and start over.
Please hold on to ALL footballs this season. Please. Peace
No. It's not fair. That's the problem with all of siemian's fand

Well yes, of course. That too
Some o-line guys too, please
Mixon for the broncos? not a fit I see your not contempt with Anderson ??
Lol what's so funny
SUCH a deep RB class! I want them all. Hope the @Broncos walk away with two. Maybe a power house like Conner paired with Mixon @johnelway
Time to boycott these wings.
Yes, every player needs a year by year evaluation.
Those bums gonna miss the playoffs again. Big D can't carry anymore duck tossing QBs
I hope this isnt some profiling bs because of whats going on in korea atm
Hes a paying customer who was told to get off the plane so they can let an employee take his seat, fuck out of here with your apologist BS
No thanks, they had the man beat because he refused to "volunteer" to give up his seat for an employee.
Sanchez already has a body of work to be judged on situation is different for young quarterbacks
The last time you guys won a p/o game Destiny's Child was still a thing. You can start talking when you win 3 or 4 straight div. titles.
No if you believe in a quarterback he needs some time to develop
It's definitely a lot to think about.. their drive, their potential, their improvements, capabilities, how they work with the team..
Well.. if we would've left Sanchez in Denver to be analyzed, rather than kicking him out after 2 crap preseason plays... imagine that record
No way

There are these things called jokes.......learn about them
if watt IS better than von, it certainly isn't by much and considering what von has done for the broncos, id keep him

I like broncos players, you don't need to take rivalries so seriously
And Elway has obviously taken too many hits to the noggin to not understand that his feelings shouldn't be associated with the team.
Although the Broncos PR man denied this is the team's position, there's clearly no difference when we read it on Broncos stationary....
Go Von go!

If that's the case I would to see the @Broncos make a move to get up in the draft to get a player they want and not settle on an OL.
There will be lots of competition among offensive and defensive linemen at @Broncos training camp. But enough to produce quality OTs & DEs?
If we trade down with the Browns and don't get Joe Thomas I will be pissed @johnelway @Broncos

Because Siemian hadn't played yet when Lynch was drafted. Probably knew they liked him but still just a 7th rd pick who had not played yet.

River is 90% back and will be ready for training camp. He is making cuts and precise routes. Working out with Edelman, Russel Wilson.

Denver will be stronger if we continue to address this offensive line issues! Go Broncos! Go raiders! I got the best of both worlds! Vegas!!
maybe like teenage prepubescent Peyton but yeah, he does.
Let lonzo be the starter. Undefeated season guaranteed

Seriously... @JJWatt is a monster but @Millerlite40 can do so much. I'd take him still. Ask Tom Brady Von is a monster!

I like this because it shows how important @ChrisHarrisJr is to the @Broncos
That's the only jersey I own!
@Broncos pls don't consider picking up C Kaepernick & destroying our beloved Broncos with a cop, Military& USA flag hater!
I watched River Cracraft for years and he's a great WR with Wes Welker type qualities
You're blaming Trump for this!? ... What next, tornadoes kill a minority, and he gets the blame? You're pathetic.
Come' on Siemen
Get River or Gabe Marks!!!!!
Why isn't Rodney Adams not on this list? Much better option than everyone other then Switzer.
I love that guy on the left. Get him!!! I'm a Seahawks fan but some team needs him. Get him!!!!
I'd take Von 10 out of 10 times. Watt is great but Miller is legendary!!

Lol! They're getting so upset they're acting like they actually lost Von. Hilarious response!
United should be bankrupt in 6 months becsuse of no one willing to fly the combative sky's with them. Dint need a boycot just common sense
Out of all bad decisions I have seen companies make this is one of the top 10 ever! I could guide UA better than current ceo
United CEO and leadership all need fired tomorrow. How a management team of such a large company can be so ignorant is unblievable

Gotta luv #the45ths racist america #BoycottUnitedAirlines
That's why I fly American most of the time. I'm not sure I've ever been on a United flight.
Very possible it could've been standby. Haven't heard any real details yet. Maybe this guy could claim discrimination . Y did they pick him?
The friendly sky's that volunteers you to leave the plane for their employees to fly then batter the person and calls them belligerent
Absolutely disgusting. This airline needs to be shut down!
This doctor had a patient waiting for him. He did not deserve to be treated like this. Damn you @united

Right. Disgusting but not surprising anymore.
Honeymoons over. It's Football time. #Horsepower
Looked crazy. First class, next flight, $500.00 voucher, I'm up. I'm betting now, this guy was flying standby.
I am sure that united escalated situation & there were multiple personnel there who probably didn't even understand y an assault occurred.

This makes me so upset! That poor man I feel so sorry 4 him
Those were TSA or cops.
He did... he bought his ticket arrived on time was seated then refused to give up his seat 4 a late arriving united employee! #assbeat
Not much choice down here, but there HAS to be more to the story.
I like the hat Von! You're a beast!
Lemme know when you see it at Ross

So many draft pundits saying the @Broncos go TE in the 1st rd., even saw one w/DEN taking mccaffrey. We all know this is OT or bust guys.

Where is Andy Dalton? 5 straight playoff appearances in 6 seasons. I saw some of players ahead of him and it was kinda disrespectful
lol I take Von over cam all day- MVP and a ring!
Yeah he's pretty legit. Stocky, but elusive enough for defenders. Reminds me of a Frank Gore.
Crap! Just watched tape on Williams, really like him. A bit slow but man is he shifty. Exactly what @Broncos don't have in their backs.

This is what happens when people smoke weed that shouldn't
think tha woman in the hiijab 2 rows up "Volunteered" him actually...
I take it your not a Military Veteran then other wise you would know what a MOS is
Y'all crazy. Von better than JJ.
I'll keep Von thanks
My Military job was Military Police nothing fancy about it I spent most of my time at the Gates

Broncos would still take Von miller over jj watt any day
Ima wear a hijab to stay safe
Agree 100% and they should have!!
Love JJ Watt but Von has shown more productivity and ROI
Never. Von GOAT
United could of put its Employees on another Air Lines and saved everyone the trouble.
We will still take vonnie @Millerlite40 but thanks.
MOS?
My MOS was 31-B I would tell United Airlines employees to do their own dirty work and I would walk myself off the plane.
Sure, very possible. Notice how everyone quick with their camera phones, but NO ONE quick to stand up and volunteer. Think about that.
I second that... @Millerlite40 #SB50 #MVP > @JJWatt and all his #DPOY awards

Fly Alaska Airlines or Delta Airlines but never fly United Airlines unless your into S&M, free beatings on every flight.
Stop, or I'll say stop again! To what point should one go before using force?
I would bet the Vikings would love to have drafted Dalton instead of Ponder
put on leave until investigation is typical. He will be back as he did nothing wrong.
Terrible incident.
Boycott @united and sue @united until it bankrupted.
And a wrong way to do the job the Police Officer is not a credit to the men in blue.
Really the Police Officer was suspended after this, hopefully he will be fired for his actions, there is a right way to do this job.

Yes!
shame on you United!

I don't see how Dalton doesn't get into the first round of this when there are still a decent amount of teams without a good QB
Why do I think the folks at @Pepsi are relieved today.
Nice to see Marcus Gilbert get some respect here. Very underrated
Because he's been the best player in the game since he was drafted let alone the best defensive player.
Boring.
Take the $800 and smile or this will happen to you.

United has sunk to a new low- terrible for more than 25 years
Will not fly unless absolutely required, I'll drive 18hrs first.
They probably could say he was interfering with the flight, failure to obey flight attendants, etc... imagine the fine print on ticket.
They should go bankrupt over this IMO.

Is there any thought to STH's in the scheduling. Prices raised and then STHs forced to pay to see starters play 2 series entire preseason
Nope! I'm sticking to @Amtrak for domestic travel from now on...
I like always playing them last game. It's like playing a Div II team to boost confidence
Ok thank you
damn I never knew he had blood coming out his mouth.
I don't play what if games. Could he? Sure. Did he? Nope. I'm not trading my Super Bowl MVP for a DPOY.
Actually you're wrong
means we are in AZ and Tennessee.
@Broncos preseason schedule includes games against the Packers, Cardinals and on the road against the Bears and 49ers. #KDVR #broncos
Whoever wrote this is high.
Absolutely disgraceful! Hopefully someone sues them.

Oh, that is a very viable argument too. Look, this draft was loaded with monsters. Almost no way to not pick a great player & win.
What is with the Cleveland love affair? Can't we get someone else for a change?
No. Never voluntarily give up your sovereign rights to some overbearing functionary.

thank the world for the Browns!
So theyre all road games
High five, @titans !
Apparently @united only gets in their "Fly the Friendly Skies" mood, if you live through the beating before takeoff.
Awesome!
Well at least they tossed him before the took off
This is horrible. Poor guy.
Not so much while on the ground.
The way it looks it's kinda confusing.

I understand that Skotty, I don't drink the cool aid. It will come across that HMR is drinking that coolaid under that account.
The opinions expressed by the MHR Twitter do not line up with all of our thinkings
My boys back & better than ever
Trevor was in no way elite last season, but as far as a 1st year starter goes, he drastically exceeded expectations. And can develop further
Yes, we do.
Game On
@IanStClair @Skotty_Payne approve.
It has nothing to do with that. The one thing I loved about MHR was they were sucking seimians teet like the rest of the pages.
LOL. Tell the @Broncos to say some flattering things about Lynch once in a while then.
@Broncos Vance Joseph will do well, but if #JohnElway will "fire" a good friend/Superbowl winner like Kubiak, how much room will he have?
Wow Paxton lynch gained weight
You guys should know better. Are you really buying this? My gut is u r stirring the pot. Siemian is freaking awful
So 8-8?
Ah heck yeah!
Everyone reading into everything toooo much. Coaches have barely anything to go on re: tape and hands on work with both players.
I'm w Vic cant stand these fake front running fans pick teams willy nilly bc theyre good Whatever happened to having pride where u come from

pls no more political bs this season. I just wanna watch football....it's so hard.
Wrong. Vance Joseph said it is Lynch, not Siemian, who isn't reading defenses correctly. Listen to what the @Broncos front office is saying. https:// twitter.com/broncomilitia/ status/851518645083582464 …

Let's bang
No way, forever @Millerlite40 #Broncos
Trevor Siemian is “full go” and “no issues” according to @Broncos HC Vance Joseph. Had offseason left shoulder surgery. #NFL
Trevor The jizz & Pax are our future! #DB4L
Vance Joseph said “it’s hard to say” if the @Broncos LT is currently on the roster. #NFL
Then here's hoping Lynch makes a huge step forward. Haha. pic.twitter.com/AZbjIMVR0S
I'm still taking von miller over watt
Only going by what the @Broncos are saying. They clearly prefer Trevor over Lynch. Best you get used to that reality now. ;)
"In hindsight we should've taken Watt instead." - Does this not sound incredibly stupid to anyone else?
In what universe do the Broncos not take von miller? I don't want to live on that timeline. Buuuuuuuurp

He's a tough sungun. Go get'em, Trev!
Hope so! It's been too damn long! What a season tho!
Looks like Manning in the face!
@Broncos have traded for Cardarelle Jones from @packers . At least THEIR (not there) QB got taller?

Its ur avi
Would you like to be re-accommodated to the @Broncos ? Pretty please with a cherry on top? @johnelway can we plz make this happen? #broncos

Why do @Broncos fans bash either QB? Lynch now has as much (actually more) experience than Siemian last year, so may best man win in camp.

all still young too except for talib
So 8-8, nothing wrong with that.
Ticking down the "tile game day" clock! #footballismylife
Keep expecting pass defense to regress like usually happens with spectacular pass D's. Keeps not happening! Tribute to those players.
