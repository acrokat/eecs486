Fair enough
No need for dui players or peds cheaters
Both trash?
Neither
@OHSKnightMedia @FIEagleSports @knights_ohs @AthleticsBronco @RHSPantherBB @Jaguars @thatoneguyjason @JaxShrimp @JaxArmadaFC
I'd love to have either one of them, but if we go DL at 4, I don't see McCaffrey falling to us in the second
But I can't remember the last time I saw a TE in the top 5
Mixon is a great talent, probably a top 15 pick if he didn't have the off the field issues. I love Howard and think he'd be great for Blake,
Fournette or McCaffrey would be my guess
I like Mixon. And Howard is consistent, something they couldn't get out of Julius Thomas
True, I just don't see the brass going for Howard at 4th. I see a lot of the comparisons to Olsen but I think it'll either be RB or DL at 4
TE OJ Howard in 1st round and RB Mixon in 2nd would fix a lot of the offense
Yep, plus the maturity of Myles Jack and Jalen Ramsey. Don't forget about Bouye either!
True, we finished 8th overall last year I believe, and the additions we made should be huge, along with Fowler and Yannick entering year 2
Definitely, hoping for Fournette at #4 and a slide from Engram to grab him in the second
JVille has loaded up on D in off season, if they get any O , could be good
yep. Blackmon had an ass load o talent , a waste. Jacksonville D is insane
Yeah A-Rob and A-Hurns is a legit combo. Maybe the #Jaguars select a TE/RB in the draft to help out Bortles
As a lifelong Jaguars fan, I was extremely disappointed In the entire Blackmon situation, but I think A-Rob is a much better player for us
For sure
Solid points
yep
agreed , got to stay off the happy weed but , the dude has skillz
Oh fair enough. Definitely Gordon then. Blackmon showed serious promise in year one but Gordon dominated better competition with worse QBs
Based on skills, not on suspension mind you
Blackmon and Gordon have been out for so long that I think I'd have to choose Martavis
Yeah, Gordon is damn good.
@Snack_TimeFS @Browns @Jaguars @JustBlack81 Martavis a good one , but I don't know if he's better than Gordon ! Gordon is damn good?
@Jaguars Adams or Allen , Mixon in the 2nd round .. I'll be so satisfied #NFLDraft17
@Jaguars hi, can we not draft an O-lineman in the top 4 again please https:// twitter.com/nfldraftscout/ status/851131290476740608 …
Gordon
Same it's a shame he turned out the way he did
Lemme guess Martavis?
Neither
Get this, I had/have all 3 of them!!!! Flashbacks!!!!
You mean the guy who was once the best WR in the league or a steaming pile of dodo? Hmmm...though choice...
#FreeMartavis indeed haha
MARTAVIS FREEKING BRYANT cmon @nflcommish #FreeMartavis
Yeah while he was suspended too lol
i knew it was for those dui he had a couple back to back
Thanks for the clarification!
...been lifted yet.
His is an indefinite suspension. His original suspension was for a DUI, but then he kept getting them while he was suspended. Just hasn't...
what happened to blackmon why has he not been back by now
Good chance he will for sure
the answer is Gordon though hope he plays this year
Lmao
Why aren't we going after Mangold? @Jaguars
no thanks
@RTFantasyFball
I heard Me Me Me Me!

No good o line there. They'd have to move to 12-15 range
Offensive line is #1 need for them. No one to take that high though.
In case you forgot @Jaguars https:// twitter.com/zachsoileau/st atus/819910072432230402 …
@DeshaunWatson4 hope the @Jaguars get you at 4....
What are the chances he does go to the Jags? Have to think they have bigger needs than rb.
HIRE HER
Okay, take him at 4, @Jaguars .
What Calais @Campbell93 had to say about his big plans for the @Jaguars this season and why he chose the Team. http:// on.nfl.com/fBFIa4
I can vouch for this!!!!
@Jaguars How many Retweets for a Signed Blake Bortles jersey?
Cause of money that team is terrible .. I don't have to watch it to know that ..?
The way he talks
I hope enjoyed playing in the few playoff games you did lose in. Cuz you won't even get to go lose in the playoffs anymore there
I like the fact that I can be rich with the Jags...
Skrilla perhaps? Lol
More power for you alone w/o defensive teammates. MY #so disrespectful. One is the loneliest #you'll ever be.
what up wit this niggas voice

You mean
He sucks and so does Jacksonville. Idiot
"I like the fact that it can be MY defense." @Campbell93 explains why he chose the @Jaguars . http:// snpy.tv/2nUoPOI
. Watch what you say idk you
Oh. You're a Panthers fan and you want LF to drop to you
Are you stoned?
Draft Fournette. Kiper is an idiot
Ummmm @Jaguars https:// twitter.com/nfldraftinside r/status/850884293060694016 …

@jaguars sleep on watson if talk want to 4th pick
I am the best candidate for this position because I always know whats going on before everyone @Jaguars #SocialJagsJob

I'm ready for the NFL Draft to hurry and come. I been ready to turn up with @Jaguars and the family can't wait to see the №4 Pic #GoJags
Price wouldn't be as nice after the draft though. Even of they draft fournette he gets the pass catchinh work.
He is so cheap
So did my QB in 2015.
my QB would've made the Pro Bowl if he didn't get injured so your statement confuses me
he's cheap and moving into a Gio role would be great for him. He's progressed as a pass catcher each year
Your QB plays 2nd fiddle in your offense and has no WR to throw to.
Why exactly? He's had plenty of chances to produce but hasn't really.
Buying any rb before the draft is crazy to me. You just never ever know.
I wouldn't buy into any RB until after the draft unless the are for sure the "lead dog." Too many nice buy low situations are created.
@NFLTotalAccess @Campbell93 @Jaguars @NFL technically his leg ain't broke anymore but at least we can talk about how we got a QB
Even if the @Jaguars draft Fournette, I am still buying Yeldon in #dynastytrades
@Jaginoff If the #Jaguars traded their 2nd and 5th to the #Chiefs in order to get their first, and @Jaguars chose TJ Watt, how'd you react?
@Patriots trading Tom Brady to @Jaguars would be a Bom Trady @tbrady14
Hey @Jaguars ! I applied & would be THE BEST candidate! I eat, breathe, and sleep social media #SocialJagsJobs

Yes. That's a possibility.

Retweet this tip from the @Jaguars own, @Campbell93 ​, for a chance to win Calais Campbell memorabilia! #giveaway https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=ziG941 7f4mk …
The @ROARoftheJags auditions more important to @jaguars than #NFLDraft because folks stopped paying attention to team on field years ago
Hope the @Jaguars don't let everyone down with the draft again. Last year and the Bortles draft class were 2/10 in the past decade.
SO excited for this! Congrats little bro! @jaguars @fans02784342 pic.twitter.com/WnOJnUfhYS

with what QB...?
I would have to assume the Orioles pull enough fans and the Yanks too to stop a blackout. Could be something else
. @Campbell93 's has big plans for the @Jaguars this season. http:// on.nfl.com/fBFIa4
Makes sense now. Just blew my mind how I'm 5 hours from Baltimore yet I'm getting the game on the west coast.
Sometimes if the home game does not have enough attendance they will blackout the game and show another Usually it's just with the @Jaguars
@Campbell93 is on @NFLTotalAccess talking about signing with the @Jaguars .
