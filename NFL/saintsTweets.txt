You, me, and a bunch of other folks that realize he's exactly the player that they need to get that defense "back on track".....
AP still in NOLA @Saints ?
Well since money is not a main priority for him...I think they will get him...we can make it to the super bowl and he wants to help us.
Im ok with that 100% .
They're busy looking at @Haason7Reddick film.......

Don't stress...you know they usually stay quiet and don't say much when they're making a deal...let's see what happens.
@Saints vs Browns here in The Land! Goal set. #firstsaintsgame

Guess he'll be lighting the torch when @RamsNFL host @Saints this year. Too bad @JLaurinaitis55 never got to play in Fearsome 4some unis :/
@Saints
Naaah man. Ingram is a good 3 down back. We need to sign AP for that missing back for pass catching.
@MikeDetillier do you expect the @saints to hold off on any trades or signings till the draft begins

Yet another good reason for the @Saints to draft you in a couple of weeks!!
@Saints sign @AdrianPeterson please. We can use his talents in the back feild

Alright guys let's not belittle each other, even if I am unbeatable on 2k
@nick_underhill @Saints may have found the answer their lack of pass-rush
@NFL @Saints @SeanPayton can yall plz get this guy on staff? He's won super bowl 20 times straight on madden & is ready to step his game up.
@Saints don't let that mean leave without a contract

@saints will give one of our thirds for him. https:// twitter.com/profootballtal k/status/851874188788944896 …
Let me know if you find out. That would be nice. Then we can get rid of Ingram, who only does good when pushed by another RB.

Just waiting on Adrian Peterson news like @LarryHolder @Saints @JSiglerNFL
it must've been an old discounted Reggie Bush jersey and I thought it was Rafael Bush I have no clue
PHOTOS: Meet the 2017 @Saintsations ! http:// bit.ly/2pqnW0E pic.twitter.com/p2dL2pjDLL
why he had it on?
I think he's actually better suited to play the "Will" -- but he's TALENTED enough to make plays no matter where you line him up
Agreed -- I had them taking Hendrickson in my Mock last week
I like Reddick too but I don't want to see him taken 11th overall! They can trade back for him
When I see someone wearing a @Saints jersey in NY I gotta ask cause one time I said #Whodat to one and he went "huh?" https:// twitter.com/nicolesaints25 /status/851838385547337728 …
I keep checking my twitter every 5 mins to see if the @Saints got Adrian Peterson
Signing AP @saints
. @JohnDeShazier discusses all things #Saints on today's @blackbluereport podcast: http:// bit.ly/2p43zHl via @ABCautoinsurers pic.twitter.com/EIjJKCc8ZS
If they go Reddick they have to draft Jordan, Basham, Walker or Hendrickson to fortified the run on early downs.
@6 '1" 230lbs not buying him as a DE. I believe he could excel at any LB position & love his ability to play in space but not to set the edge
Congratulations on making the @Saints cheer squad Lil mama! @MadOverby
Coming up on today's podcast via @ABCautoinsurers : @dsallerson talks Pels w/ @Jim_Eichenhofer & @Saints preseason schedule w/ @JohnDeShazier
Enjoyed having @CamSutton23 from @Vol_Football on @SiriusXMNFL Blitz. Has had privates w/ @Patriots @Saints @Titans and @AtlantaFalcons .
kiper and mcshay both mocked him there last week. hmmm.
YEA! should probably move there!!!
Yea! Should probably move there!
You think he can be a WLB? I see the athletic ability but is he 1st round worthy? Especially that high?
Nothing on AP???????????
@saints how many retweets for an autographed Brees jersey?
@Saints and I want them to get Reuben Foster at 11.....but a we need a cornerback......hell anybody on defense https:// twitter.com/__wag_/status/ 851829534601117700 …
I see 1 maybe 2 easy wins there.
RT @nfldraftscout : Hasson Reddick to the @Saints ? I've heard they like him a lot. Great fit in that 4-3 scheme, too.
What's up with AP, Butler or Sherman?

If Reddick is the pick at 11 who is the pick at 32? Kevin king, Curtis Samuel, or Charles Harris?
absolutely!
@RapSheet any word about the @AdrianPeterson meeting with the @Saints yet?
Waiting On @Saints News .
Can he Play the SLB? Already have a good WLB in Robertson and signed two MLBs in Te'o and Klein
@Saints also finally trades OT T. Armstead and a 3 to the @RAIDERS for a 1/3 in this years draft.
Easy win for the Fish

Dang. The whole squad in here having babies. Let me find out y'all planned this around off-season. @Willie_Snead4G @Saints
Would already probably be a top 3 player on their defense.

I concur. He will allow it
Who do you think the @Saints pick at 11th out of Barnett, Charlton and Reddick?
I'll allow it
Colin will take y'all all the way...
Im worried bout week 1 cuz 1-0 = no 7-9
Hey @Saints who should I talk to about real estate referrals from the Saints organization?
If both are available for the saints, do you like Reddick or Barnett?
I want him for my skins at 19,
RT @nfldraftscout : Hasson Reddick to the @Saints ? I’ve heard they like him a lot. Great fit in that 4-3 scheme, too.
he can every LB spot imo.
Even over foster? I just don't see how they can pass up on him
How do you feel about chidobe awuzie to the Steelers at 30? I like his versatility and we need secondary help
@saints make it make happen @Seahawks #WhoDat https:// twitter.com/bryantnr/statu s/851216133952811011 …
PLZZZZ
I'll take him he has excellent cover skills and ball skills. Plus can rush the passer.
Do they take him over Reuben Foster if both are available though?
Go big or go home @Saints @SeanPayton
Pfft. Incentive laden contract...paid out mostly in salt lick and moss. I think we're good.

That deer has far too high of a cap hit for the Saints to absorb.
Where would be play? WLB and Blitz on 3rd downs kinda like Ellerbe last year?
Hasson Reddick to the @Saints ? I've heard they like him a lot. Great fit in that 4-3 scheme, too.

You guys dont even have cooks anymore...
I hope @dbarnett25 falls to @saints #11 pick
@jay_gizzle better wake up, make banana pancakes and watch from your couch!
Understandable. Even a 16:30 local kickoff would get tons more viewers in the states. But enjoy! How do you say "Who Dat" in Finland?

Leave the Jaguars in London.
When do we know what date the Vikings/Browns game will be?
Finally!!! After seasons of attempts @Saints has traded Russel Wilson to @packers for K. Short. Packers now more vulnerable to QB sneak
Any news on Ravens and Jags?
The @Saints bringing in a injured running back, while already having one that's been injured, is like leaving your bm to be with another bm.
Means we can get home in time to catch end of the 6pm games and watch 9pm
So Ravens 1800?
4 yr 34 million dollars for Larry Warford hold this L @Saints
Great news
Love this...
Not so for Ravens then? Shame
Yes! The gamble on a ticket for a three year old has paid off!

Would to see @_fournette go to my @Saints but no matter where he goes, I will have a jersey even if it's @Panthers ! Right @brookeplank
All I know is if the @Saints land @RSherman_25 & @Mac_BZ we would be the Island of New Orleans. Under sea level an drowning receivers...

@Saints https:// twitter.com/nfl/status/851 211898053951488 …
Richard Sherman Or Butler @Saints ?
Hopefully the @Saints can make a good impression on @AdrianPeterson that he will signed with us on the spot #AP2DaSaints #LoomisMakeItHappen
@Saints Bring him home https:// twitter.com/nfl/status/851 483690895101953 …
Leonard Fournette
@The1DanielBrown @Saints @LarryHolder Unless there is an injury he won start but he could play an important role.
Let's make that move & bring him back @Saints https:// twitter.com/nfl/status/851 483690895101953 …

Hey, @Saints , @__TPorter__ part 2?
@Saints https:// twitter.com/TaneishaJane/s tatus/851453980639145985 …
would u take John Ross if he dropped to 32?
https:// twitter.com/ESPNNFL/status /851464991186325504 … @evansaacks @Saints fans in general cmon porter as a backup corner couldn't hurt. I think we would all welcome him.
A situational back not a top 10 pick.
curtis samuel pls
Think
I we get Malcom Butler but AP looking kinda murky
Sign AP, trade Ingram and a late pick to the browns and draft myles Garrett @1. Trade the 32nd lick back to new England for butler. @saints
Malcom Butler @Saints ? Adrian Peterson @Saints ?
Just draft DEFENSE @Saints with those 1st two picks.
Idk why there is no place that sells the all white @Cantguardmike jersey? @Saints you got a link?
@Saints https:// twitter.com/rapsheet/statu s/851444802658938881 …

That's odd..analysts have said he's closer to Faulk and LT... let's aim a touch higher coach Payton! ;)

Not sure why @AdrianPeterson is even meeting with the @Saints after what they did to the @Vikings in 2009 #stillsalty #attemptedmurderon4

GOD BLESS YOU GUYS..
Pats traded that pick
Um.....the Pat's don't have #32. They traded it to NO for Cooks.
Congratulations to you and your family may God continue to bless you
Yeah u right respect for that. Champ!
Snead as in Willie Snead? Not a Pat. No one on Pat's named "Snead," who have #32, and Snead wouldn't be a good enough player anyway.
That's until john jones comes back...... then he will just be history
@Saints Sean Peyton needs to take charge of his team there is too much slack going on
I think so tooo but everybody say your a bandwagon sooo guess I am one & some

Good Shefty! Then let's get him traded to the @Saints #MakeItHappenMickey
I need to see my squad play @Saints you know what it is
I'm a diehard Raiders fan, but I support my hometown Philadelphia Eagles as my 2nd team.
I believe you're allowed to be a fan of (2) teams in each sport. Your hometown team & the team you genuinely like. Philly is my 2nd team
PSA: I AM A @Saints fan regardless of win, lose, or draw.. I will remain a @Saints fan but I will also b on the @RAIDERS bandwagon too

Watch TommyLee Lewis be the one who replace Cooks for the @Saints
@Saints gathered among the disciples to trade Drew Bree's Lambo but @Patriots offered to allow Manning's wife's $30k glossy tugboat!
Me too love the Saints. Can we get Adrian Peterson!?

Hey @Saints , it's my birthday.
Now that sounds like a great idea. You would be a pleasant addition . Break the mold and go get em
You should. You would have many fans
the @Saints are incapable of making a smart decision such as getting a bonified lock down DB like Sherman.

Congrats to my man @Zeddy_33 on an outstanding day. Next stop, @Saints workout. #NFLDraft https:// twitter.com/Zeddy_33/statu s/850542102622736384 …
I am a @Saints fan, good years, and the bad, too! Kinda like @aarongreenberg with the raiders! Hahaha
I think he could.. He's a good runner quick on his feet and very effective .. #5starhero
Them Seahawk players will never get over what happened in the super bowl that's why they all wanna leave
Ha hah. If anyone can stand next to you and not beam a huge smile either youre a dirtybird fan or youve been constipated and NOW is go time!
You got this. Continue to work hard
hell fuckin a
I don't get why everyone is so hell bent on the @Saints getting another RB so bad. @MarkIngram22 has been killing it. #Feedthebeast
When this is over, I know a gal @saints &scissors scottsdale who does MAGICAL foils to fix that. You look GORGEOUS afterward. Sabel.
I Remember These The Days I Prayed For.. Since I Was A Young Boy.. I Visualized Myself Here ,This Exact Moment! Didnt Ever Give Up ! @Saints pic.twitter.com/54vFjMlmGE
WE DON'T NEED HIM, HE IS TRASH @Saints pic.twitter.com/QBVFLSKXKl
Idk...take a look at every great cb or secondary and look at their front 7...the front 7 is usually pretty good
He'd be good but Saints would need that 2nd pass rusher. Earl Thomas is a big part of Seattle's success. Just don't know enough about Bell
Depends on our personnel around him and our scheme!
I think he'll be just fine. Sherman can hold his own.
I think he'll definitely be good. Not that Seattle level though
The @saints will be like they were before pre-Katrina, trash baby girl https:// twitter.com/kingshvwntrece _/status/850508520189558784 …
I remember seeing you play. Didn't realize you were a senior then. Stay grinding though
If @Saints get Richard Sherman would he be a lockdown corner like he is in Seattle or will he be w disappointment? Thoughts?
@cajun_cousin thanks cousin for following me please let your followers know I follow back GEAUX @Saints
