dalton and brady only qbs active that average more then 10 wins a season. dalton just needs to get over the playoff hump
problem is dalton is one of the best regular season qbs there is today. no joke.
: I don't have to click on this link. I already know that the @Bengals best all-time draft pick is Anthony Muñoz. https:// twitter.com/sinow/status/8 50850798137483266 …
It won't happen but it might be the way we should go
I still have hope he is cut June 1 but I'm sure it's wishful thinking
This is a very important year for everyone in Cincinnati
Who do you want the bengals to take
Hey everybody make mistakes in there life your parents would know a lot about that!!
#BringBackAkiliSmith
Hey cincy fans can handle torture we have all been @Bengals fans for our entire life!! Almost as bad as watching the @Eagles play
@Bengals please draft this man pic.twitter.com/JfM8asGOPW
@Bengals I say bring Sheldon Richardson in, playmaker and will shore up the defense. #whodey
That's our boy at 9. #whodey

Production, but vs opponents who are also highly rated
If @Bengals traded McCarron to CLE for pick 33, what QB may fall to them in rds 2-4 that make a suitable backup? #AskTheScouts
Bengals went 6-9-1 because @LILBTHEBASEDGOD did not bless Cincy

@Bengals draft Mike Williams stop talking to dalvin cook thank you
Sometimes I wonder how much of that is ML or MB decision as far as loyalty to starting players even when there performance is sub par.
That logic would make sense if not for Hill and Rex...there is some doubt the @Bengals might not play the best player
The @Bengals will pick @T26Brock up. They are known for this type of player. #noexcuse #donthitgirls #wachurmamateachu

Only if they are planning on playing him at tackle... which I'm ok with

That's pretty good, I almost would want to go DE in the 3rd but pocic/elflien is the next best thing
i will have to tweet my mock later but i did end up with pocic in 3rd mixon 2nd and allen 1st
Hoping the Bengals select Gus the mule in the NFL Draft. We could use a kicker who can make 100yd fieldgoals! @Disney @Bengals #GusMovie

COLLEGE PRODUCTION
Everyone is, that wouldnt surprise. Other teams need to grow a pair and make moves
He's probably going to Patriots
@Bengals go get Rich Sherm
26 teams in the #NFL and only 24 pennants. Wonder why there's no #HoustonOilers or @Bengals ?
Yes sir
@Bengals
The Bengals HAVE to trade McCarron before draft. Value will never be higher, and one of the deepest drafts in history. Get it done @Bengals
Size! A lot of intangibles can effect college production, but 6-foot-6 is 78 inches, there's no getting around it.

Marshon Lattimore, the 240 pound cornerback that runs a 4.3. That stench on the field in the receivers' pure fear lol
I mean Does that look like a cornerback build? If that's they guy covering me I'd just come up lame my first play
Lol how is it that hard to get an actual picture of Lattimore? He redshirted during the champ season so wouldn't have even been on field lol

Haha. With a buttoned up shirt underneath! Just like the pros do it.
Take Switzers pick and turn it into a Speedy WR then it's perfect
Take that first fourth with vanderdoes and take a better Oline than orlosky, then use the second 4th and take Zane Gonzalez
Switzer doesn't fit our offense and vanderdoes I don't think is a great good pick. Too many Dlne picks in there
I like the fields and boulware picks late. I think you can get Jon toth In 6 or 7 round who I like.
Anything is possible but I don't see this at 9... @Bengals will have higher rated players

Your town had a river that caught on fire; even water refused to stay in loserville
If it weren't for the Browns, there would be no Bengals. Bengals are Clevelands sloppy seconds
I thought it was 68 years....
Do the browns and indians have the same number of titles in fifty years? That seems weird...
Are the @Reds like the @Bengals where half their team is on parole? Asking for a friend
Regardless of what the record at the end of season may be - still show love for your hometown teams @Reds @Bengals

I'd like to see the @Bengals do a who Dey parade & city shut streets down for some tailgate partying prior to Week 1
So.... When do the @Bengals kick it off? #RedsOpeningDay
I think it was impressive to see the @Bengals out supporting the Reds today... PSHHH pic.twitter.com/kmVUvkT0DH
Hey @Bengals , the @Reds just did a super cool fly over. Wonder why that never happens at PBS... #cheapmikebrown
@ChicagoBears @Bengals , or @Panthers
Can we have a @Bengals parade for the opener like the @Reds do? Nothing like a #Cincy parade! Brings us all together! @WCPO #Reds #WhoDey
If the @Bengals draft strategy is BPA (best player available), all signs point to OJ Howard or Corey Davis. Possibly a Safety if one falls.

Why is Andy so hot/good at football?
why is Mike Brown such a terrible owner? His dad basically invented football, but all he cares about is money.
What is your input on who we will draft?
What's going to be the biggest obstacle the Bengals have to overcome to win some games??

@Bengals you keep Pac Man ill keep my money. Thanks for freeing up my Fall.
I give it a 5.5/ 10 tbh I only see 4 picks I really like and 2 are late rounds, also we need a kicker
Ryan Anderson won't be able to play DE though
Need OL earlier, if you want Mixon in real life take him at 41, no dbs that early and I think that Anderson is a bust but on that one do you
love baker pick, don't know much about ford, mixon and kelly , overall though I'd be happy
@Bengals @Saints come on they gotta get their own phrase be creative for once unlike Marvin Lewis's playbook. #Whodatnation

WR,WR,S,OT,C,OG,RB,DE,DE/DT,QB that sums up the need for @Bengals draft at least what I think they'll do. 1 OL can switch to LB if needed
That'd be a fantastic, either one of those two mixing in the lineup

@Bengals business idea: trade @10AJMcCarron to the @steelers
I've always loved him. One h*** of a LCB!! So glad the @Bengals decided to keep this man around! #bigfan#truefan
(2) The Browns should want McCarron reunited w/ Coach Jackson. Then sign Adrian Peterson to a short, reasonable contact...
(1)Offer McCarron, Hill,& your 1st pick for the Browns' first pick & Osweiler's ridiculous contract & draft Myles Garrett! ...
. @Bengals player may have been involved in kicking @DeshaunWatson4 out of bar http:// ift.tt/2oqextl
@Bengals It's one thing not to draft potential, like DeSean Jackson & gamble on lesser knwn JSimpson.But to miss a 3rd chance with DJ-WTF!

Yeah i get that, they want money to rebuild but 24 million? Idk I just think its a lot they could use half for a couple good player.

They have been bragging on that for years. MB would say we keep the most draft picks of any team but they would be 3-13. It is cheapness.
Haha. Nonsense. 20 of 22 return(minus the 2best OLine)from a 6-9-1 team and they consider that good continuity.

That's "still mooing" rare.
So they old Dunhumby building is getting demolished? More space for tailgating @bengals games.
It's going to be best player available. I think LB or TE.
taking the third best DE (Derek Barnett) in 9th don't seems right.
I don't think there is OL or even WR worth going in the top ten.

Pass Rusher or WR to stretch field is my guess
Speed off the edge is different than 40 speed, IMO.
True. Did he do any other timed activities today? Like 3-cone, etc. I thought I read Paul G wants some speed off the edge though?
Wow. That's rare.
ATTN: @bengals https:// twitter.com/mikegarafolo/s tatus/847832599779315712 …
Athleticism is different than sprinter speed, IMO. Speed is part of it, of course. But you can be athletic as heck but not be a sprinter.
I know he was very productive. But I'd feel better if he was more athletic. Right now I can't help think "Jarvis Jones". I hope I'm wrong.

@pauldehnerjr @Kat_Terrell @JimOwczarski Any of you think the slow 40 time will "scare" the @Bengals away from Barnett?
@Bengals I know you're about to snag with that 9th pick.

If we don't draft Derek Barnett and draft a guy who had less production against worse competiton, I'm done @Bengals
Barnett is a top 3 player in this draft production wise
@Bengals draft him please https:// twitter.com/athletepedia/s tatus/844922006864887808 …
Replace Dalton??
Depends how far we trade back, we could get 2 day to picks if we go back into the late 20's
trade back is good get another pick or 2 and still get a good edge rusher in first round
Really? Did anyone else break reggie whites sack record
Fomer @dubhouse25 / @TexasTechFB QB @PatrickMahomes5 reportedly worked out for the @Bengals this week. #bEASTTexas #TXHSFB https:// twitter.com/NFL_CFB/status /847823563461677056 …
he's not a top 10 pick and we can get a pass rusher at 41 that's similar
I think a trade back is a must do now

What? You guys need a DE he's a beast
gotta get that 3 headed qb attack with Mccaron, Dalton and Mahomes...

Get Mixon hopefully at 41.
Please don't be scared to take OJ Howard.. Who wouldn't want 2 Eifert's out there? He's a stud & he might be better.
Unless we trade up for Garrett or Allen or take the best Offensive lineman
Has to be an explosive threat (John Ross, OJ Howard, Corey Davis) or a defensive stud (Hassan Reddick, Solomon Thomas, Peppers, or Foster)@9
No surprise @Bengals . So disappointing. What type of example are you setting? If you need thugs to win, you're pathetic.
Please draft Derek Barnett at number 9
@MoveTheSticks @BuckyBrooks Sims won't be the @Bengals starting NT. @BillingsAndrew is my bet.
Very cool talking with Jack Brennan! How about retirement gift to him and wife from @Bengals ? Trip to Buenos Aires.

I guess the @Bengals are all set with their QB situation. I'll have another!
That you're wrong. Cook is a far better back than Foreman and Cook was found innocent of any charges. But being accused is enough to condemn
Yes it would, we could probably score him for a 6th
So what exactly are you arguing?
let's get it Gilz!!! #WhoDey
No need, Jerry. I know the story.
I'll help you out, bud.
I hope you mean George Foreman bc that Foreman @Texas will bust.
Google is your friend
Enlighten us. Tell us what he did.
@MoEgger1530 devon still has a child and the @bengals still cut him
Shooting out windows, animal cruelty, etc.
Yeah? Wanna go look again?
What? Lol he got in 0 trouble his whole 3 years?
Good riddance #whodey
TE or RB, and no Dalvin Cook. He's trash as a person. Let's not be the @Bengals and draft thugs. Foreman would be a good pick.

instead of mangold williams and list of other pro bowlers they sign him smh and keep convict jones.. and wonder why team dont win

we still need an oline, wr's, cb's, and a middle linebacker

Mike Brown is 1 of the many reasons I can never root for the bengals.
I will not support them this year! They don't want to win they want to put the cheapest product on the field and hope
no he does not how many chances can one man get? Actions like this and things they did in free agency is why

@Bengals ridiculous. Your organization owes the police and the people if Cincinnati for continuing to support a career criminal and menace.
(2/2) by not holding Jones accountable, @Bengals Brown thinks he is helping him/his daughter when he is really hurting them both. #Bengals
good humanitarian, terrible owner. Ask the cop's family how they feel.
